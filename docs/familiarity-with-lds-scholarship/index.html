<p>For the past 20 years I studied apologetic defenses for the Church.  I’ve read or am familiar with the essential arguments of virtually every academic (or near academic) work on the topic.  For instance, I’ve studied fairly extensively:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.fairmormon.org/perspectives/fair-conferences/2012-fair-conference/2012-reading-mormons-codex">Mormon’s Codex</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mormon-reformatted-according-parallelistic-patterns/dp/B001JMKB70">All the parallelisms in the Book of Mormon</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/book/king-benjamin-s-speech-that-ye-may-learn-wisdom/">The ancient festival interpretations for King Benjamin’s Speech</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve examined <a href="https://mormonbandwagon.com/user/david.mckane/">the data on the Hopewell Indians</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve read through most every issue of the Journal of Book of Mormon Studies and FARMS review of books, and most everything John Welch, Dan Peterson, Hugh Nibley, and other prominent apologists have written.</p>

<p>I had a subscription to BYU Studies and generally read all of each issue.  I had GospeLink2001 and the LDS InfoBase and read through very many books and articles there.</p>

<p>I am familiar most of the arguments of those who’ve written on polygamy from an apologetic perspective (e.g., <a href="http://www.millennialstar.org/free-book-or-what-i-learned-at-mha/">Meg Stout</a>, <a href="http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/">Brian Hales</a>, and am familiar with much of <a href="http://mormonpolygamydocuments.org/">the primary data</a>).</p>

<p>I’m also familiar with most every official statement or perspective related to apologetic topics (i.e., articles published in the Ensign or official Church materials).  On my mission, for instance, I went through and copied and highlighted every Ensign article that dealt with anything academic or apologetic from about 1965 to the then present day.</p>

<p>On issues I care deeply about I try to consult or communicate with the leading LDS scholars relative to that field.  For instance, I have had conversations about reconciling the Gospel with evolution with BYU professors <a href="https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Dialogue_V08N0304_43.pdf">Duane Jeffery</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Woodward">Scott Woodward</a>.  I took Pearl of Great Price while a student at BYU from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Rhodes">Michael Rhodes</a>.  I’ve discussed reconciliations of Noah’s flood with professor of geology <a href="http://www.geology.byu.edu/home/node/80">Ron A. Harris</a>.</p>
