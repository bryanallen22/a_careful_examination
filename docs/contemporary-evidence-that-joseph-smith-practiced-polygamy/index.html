    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Joseph Smith made <em>many</em> public denials that he was practicing polygamy (see <a href="http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/common-questions/polygamy-denials/">Hales’s anslysis</a> and <a href="/a_careful_examination/joseph-smith-polygamy-denials/">my analysis</a>).  In an effort to exonerate him, some take him at his word and claim that polygamy (with an emphasis on marriage during time) was a later invention of Brigham Young and other LDS leadership.</p>

<p>However, some <em>contemporary</em> evidence exists that Joseph Smith practiced polygamy.</p>

    <p>Oliver Cowdery wrote a letter to his brother discussing Joseph’s “scrape” with Fanny Alger:</p>

    <p>Oliver Cowdery’s excommunication trial was <a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-march-september-1838/16#full-transcript">recorded in Joseph Smith’s journal</a>.

<h3 id="martha-brothertons-affidavit-potential-antagonistic-bias">Martha Brotherton’s affidavit (potential antagonistic bias)</h3>

<p>Joseph and Hyrum Smith denied rumors of a proposal to Martha Brotherton <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/times-and-seasons-apr-15-1842-conference-minutes/">in the April 6, 1842 general conference</a>.</p>

<p>After Bennett left Nauvoo, he solicited an affidavit from Brotherton.  <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/martha-brotherton-affidavit/">Martha Brotherton’s affidavit</a> runs somewhat counter to many of the claims Bennett was making in his book and is fairly consistent with later testimony evidence of both the rationale advanced and the <em>modus operandi</em> for proposals that came from Latter-day Saint participants.<sup id="fnref:hales_uses_brotherton"><a href="#fn:hales_uses_brotherton" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="buckeyes-laments-antagonistic-bias">Buckeye’s laments (antagonistic bias)</h3>

<p>An insider to Nauvoo polygamy wrote two exposés on Joseph Smith’s polygamy in the Warsaw Message and then Warsaw Signal (same paper, just a change of names).  Bergera discusses the articles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100707004021/http://dig.lib.niu.edu/ISHS/ishs-2002winter/ishs-2002winter350.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="later-non-lds-testimony-corroborating-key-events">Later non-LDS testimony corroborating key events</h2>

<p>Leonard Soby was at the August 12, 1843 High Council meeting where polygamy was introduced.  Given that his rejection of the revelation led to his excommunication, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/5d9pa1/leonard_soby_18061892_converted_to_mormonism_and/">his testimony</a> seems especially relevant because he cannot be said to be biased by any possible later LDS conspiracy.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Far more contemporary evidence exists implicating Joseph Smith in polygamy than exists for most foundational LDS events (e.g., restoration of the Priesthood or the First Vision).</p>

      <p>Joseph Smith Papers editors provide <a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-march-september-1838/16#12364309435905554968">the following footnote</a> after Cowdery’s charge that Smith was guilty of adultery:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Testimony from George W. Harris, David W. Patten, and Thomas B. Marsh confirmed that Cowdery had made such insinuations about JS’s relationship in Kirtland with a young woman named Fanny Alger. At the trial, JS stated that as Cowdery “had been his bosom friend, therefore he intrusted him with many things”—apparently confirming the reality of a confidential relationship with Alger. JS then “gave a history respecting the girl business.” This history may have regarded the origins of the Mormon practice of polygamy. Revelation claimed by JS sanctioning the polygyny practiced by Old Testament patriarchs was evidently related to JS’s 1831 work on revision of the Bible. Kirtland Mormons, including Alger’s family, viewed the relationship as an early plural marriage. Nevertheless, an estranged Cowdery insisted on characterizing the relationship as “a dirty, nasty, filthy affair of his and Fanny Alger’s.”  (Minute Book 2, 12 Apr. 1838.Bachman, “Ohio Origins of the Revelation on Eternal Marriage”; Compton, In Sacred Loneliness, 27. Oliver Cowdery, Far West, MO, to Warren Cowdery, [Kirtland, OH], 21 Jan. 1838, in Cowdery, Letterbook, 80–83; see also Parkin, “Conflict at Kirtland,” 128–135.)</p>
