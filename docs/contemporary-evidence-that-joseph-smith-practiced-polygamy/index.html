    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Joseph Smith made <em>many</em> public denials that he was practicing polygamy (see <a href="http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/common-questions/polygamy-denials/">Hales’s anslysis</a> and <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/joseph-smith-polygamy-denials/">my analysis</a>).  In an effort to exonerate him, some take him at his word and claim that polygamy was an invention of Brigham Young.</p>

<p>However, fairly strong <em>contemporary</em> evidence exists that Joseph Smith practiced polygamy.</p>

<h3 id="oliver-cowderys-letter-to-his-brother">Oliver Cowdery’s letter to his brother</h3>

<p>Oliver Cowdery wrote a letter to his brother discussing Joseph’s “scrape” with Fanny Alger:</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/UXN9wpv">Oliver Cowdery’s letter to Warren A. Cowdery, Jan 21, 1838</a>.</p>

<p>Note that all surrounding events and testimony (including the fact that Cowdery never retracted his accusation) corroborate that Joseph Smith was intimately involved with Fanny Alger.</p>

<h3 id="sarah-ann-whitney-documents">Sarah Ann Whitney documents</h3>

<p>A trio of primary documents, all signed or in Joseph Smith’s hand implicate him in plural marriage with Sarah Ann Whitney.  The three documents together are difficult to explain outside the context of a plural marriage.</p>

<h3 id="buckeyes-laments-antagonistic-bias">Buckeye’s laments (antagonistic bias)</h3>

<p>An insider to Nauvoo polygamy wrote two exposés on Joseph Smith’s polygamy in the Warsaw Message and then Warsaw Signal (same paper, just a change of names).  Bergera discusses the articles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100707004021/http://dig.lib.niu.edu/ISHS/ishs-2002winter/ishs-2002winter350.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="later-non-lds-testimony-corroborating-key-events">Later non-LDS testimony corroborating key events</h2>

<p>Leonard Soby was at the August 12, 1843 High Council meeting where polygamy was introduced.  Given that his rejection of the revelation led to his excommunication, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/5d9pa1/leonard_soby_18061892_converted_to_mormonism_and/">his testimony</a> seems especially relevant because he cannot be said to be biased by any possible later LDS conspiracy.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Far more contemporary evidence exists implicating Joseph Smith in polygamy than exists for most foundational LDS events (e.g., restoration of the Priesthood or the First Vision).</p>
