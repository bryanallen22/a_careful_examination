> True that my choice of the word ‘originate’ is incorrect. The original claims of the Book of Mormon being written by Joseph Smith were from critics during his lifetime. 

While this is true and I appreciate the concession, it doesn't fully acknowledge how little the work I've referenced relies on Brodie in any direct way.

> Brodie recycled those claims and they reappear in many of your arguments (copied from the KJV, ...):

At what point do these simply become theories and not "recycled" from Brodie.  [FairMormon writes](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Anachronisms/Biblical/Deutero-Isaiah#Question:_How_do_we_explain_multiple_.22Isaiahs.22_and_the_Book_of_Mormon.3F) (emphasis added):

> When considering **the large quantity of KJV Bible quotations in the Book of Mormon** many **LDS scholars** have proposed a scenario like this:

> As Joseph was translating the text of the Book of Mormon, he would find himself translating something that he recognized as being roughly similar to texts from the Bible. This would occur most prominently when Nephi quotes from Isaiah.
Instead of translating Nephi's quotations of Isaiah, **Joseph, deferred to the KJV translation of those chapters**. **This may have been done to save time and to respect the quality of the KJV Bible. The chapters of Isaiah that we find in the Book of Mormon were taken largely by Joseph Smith from the KJV Bible, instead of being translated from Nephi's version of that text**. In other words, why reinvent the wheel when the work has already been done?

Would you describe LDS scholars as simply "recycling" Brodie when they create models where Joseph copied from the KJV?

> Brodie recycled those claims and they reappear in many of your arguments (..., other sources of his day, etc)

My understanding is that critics like Brodie postulated that Smith was closely referencing other works (e.g., View of the Hebrews).  If you go through all the sources I've listed, you'll find almost unanimous agreement among modern historians and researchers that Joseph likely didn't directly copy from anything (other than perhaps the Bible for some large chunks).  Vogel discusses this in his introduction [here](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/scripture-test/) ("I have, of course, tried to include all sources which would have been available in the area where Joseph Smith grew up and later worked. These sources do not prove but merely **suggest Joseph’s exposure to the subject**").  The authors of [the Late War analysis](http://wordtree.org/thelatewar/) describe it as a "remix" (meaning, the Book of Mormon was influenced by ideas in the environment but wasn't a direct plagiarism [again, besides perhaps the Bible]).  And frogontrombone is making the argument that the Book of Mormon fits within the theory of componential creativity which suggests that "creativity is a novel combination of pieces taken from ideas that an individual has been exposed to (domain knowledge, in this case, the intimate knowledge of the cultural and religious milieu)" rather than copying sources.

> They rely on the assumption that JS was a well-read scholar

If we take Joseph Smith at his word when he described his interests and abilities, then it requires no assumptions at all.  Please carefully read the emboldened sections of his own description of his religious upbringing, familiarity with the Bible and familiarity with the various religious arguments of the day [here](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/joseph-smith-capable-of-authoring-the-book-of-mormon/#own-statements).

Also, please read William Davis's dissertation (it's a bit of a slog but well worth it).  He makes a strong case for the kind of scholarship that we might have expected someone like Joseph Smith to have been capable of and also how it was very common for people in similar positions as Smith to downplay their educational attainments (e.g., John Bunyan author of Pilgrim's Progress).

> a genius wordsmith

The Book of Mormon seems simplistic in comparison to much of what he wrote and dictated immediately after the BoM and also later in his life.  See a couple of examples [here](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/reasons-to-discount-emmas-bom-testimony/#could-not-write-or-dictate-a-coherent-and-well-worded-letter).

> photographic memory

This may have been a component of older models (Brodie?), but neither Hamer, Vogle, the Johnson brothers, ImTheMarmotKing, frogontrombone, or myself are arguing this.  He did have an extraordinary intellect (see [Intellectual powers](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/joseph-smith-capable-of-authoring-the-book-of-mormon/#intellectual-powers)).

> could tell oral stories consisting of complex civilizations (comparable to JRR Tolkien)

See William Davis PhD dissertation for a discussion on this.

> without notes or repetition,

Again, Davis discusses *how* this kind of thing can be done.

> that ancient texts were written on metal plates,

I discuss how writing ancient texts on metal plates was in fact an idea floating around Joseph's milieu and ways in which what is described about the Golden Plates is in tension with what we know about writing on metal plates from the ancient Middle East and ancient America here:

[A short critique of discovered metal tablets as evidence for the authenticity of the Book of Mormon](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/short-critique-metal-tablets-as-evidence-for-bom/)

> fabricated plates to show to 11 others

Examples of ancient looking plates with ancient looking inscriptions that were created roughly in Joseph Smith's time period are the Kinderhook Plates and the [Voree Plates](http://www.strangite.org/Plates.htm).  Hence, it does not seem impossible for these kinds of things to be fabricated.

Are you aware of [Vogel's theory on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmX-H1GBivk)?  The general concealment of the plates in a metal cloth suggest that the plates may not have been able to pass visual inspection except under controlled circumstances.  And the fact that it was necessary for an angel to take back the plates also suggests that close inspection of the plates was undesirable.  It goes without saying that none of this discussion would even be necessary if we simply had the plates and could analyze them like was done with the Kinderhook plates.

> formulated doctrinal answers to questions posed by preachers and religious scholars of the day

Again, according to his own hand-written account, he had studied the Bible in depth and was familiar enough with the other denominations that "by searching the scriptures I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that they had apostatised from the true and liveing faith".  And by 1830-1 he was [incorporating Adam Clarke's Bible Commentary in "hundreds" of instances into his own translation of the Bible](http://jur.byu.edu/?p=21296).

Hence, we have two data point with which to draw a straight line: his reminiscences about his scripture searching and religious questioning as a 12-15 year old and his incorporation of Clarke into his own Bible Translation shortly after the Book of Mormon.  The Book of Mormon fits neatly between those two points in sophistication, I think.  You are free to disagree, of course.

> all by the age of 24

According to his own 1832 handwritten account, by the age of 12--15 he had already determined that the various religions were false by his study of scripture.  Do we have evidence suggesting that he stopped being interested in the Bible and religious questions of the day between 15 and 24?  And did he suddenly become capable of consulting and weighing sophisticated Bible commentaries just after the dictation of the BoM but not before?

> while spending most of his time farming or performing other physical labor

I know that Vogel identifies [18 treasure digging sites](http://www.mormonstories.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Treasure-Digging-Sites-and-History-vogel.pdf) Joseph participated in.  Regardless of whether he was farming or treasure digging, remember that they did not have many other forms of entertainment (e.g., television), so reading from the Bible, debating, and telling stories, etc, were major pasttimes.  Again, this is detailed in William Davis's dissertation.

> That story is much more fantastical than the claim that Joseph Smith was inspired by God to translate (sometimes referred to as “interpret”) an ancient text.

My argument is that it's impressive but not fantastical once you fully appreciate his abilities and the milieu he lived in.  You are welcome to consider it fantastical, of course.  The original facebook poster wanted to know *how* people who don't believe in LDS truth-claims think about the creation of the Book of Mormon, and I'm simply explaining the best naturalist model as I understand it.

> As a foreign language teacher, I have no problem with phrases used in the Book of Mormon translation that are also found in other sources.  The nature of translation is that words and phrases used are influenced by knowledge and experience of the translator.

If it were only phraseology, then I would agree.

But every time we closely examine the text of the Book of Mormon it appears to be reliant on the early 1800s milieu and not merely using phraseology from the early 1800s.  It's a subtle distinction, but it's important.

For instance, Bible scholars suspect that the ending of the Book of Mark was a later addition cobbled together from multiple distinct sources.  This wasn't known in Smith's day and the KJV Bible was based on a small fraction of the manuscripts that Bible scholars are in possession of today (you may disagree with Ehrman on a lot of things, but his [presentation on the KJV Bible explains this fairly well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehnEZtqj2Mo)).  We just don't expect ancient native Americans to be quoting long sections of the end of Mark, but we would expect to see that if the author is simply working off the KJV.  [Moroni quoting dubious sections of Mark](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/moroni-quotes-sections-of-mark-dubious-origin/).  This exceeds choices in phraseology, I think.



I’ve read a lot of your links
(thank you for sharing). Here’s one I suggest that describes further the
intellectual and spiritual process of translating (interpreting) done by a
seer.
