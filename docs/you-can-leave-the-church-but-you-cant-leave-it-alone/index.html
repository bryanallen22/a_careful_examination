    <p>[Very rough draft]</p>

<h2 id="inaccurate">Inaccurate?</h2>

<p>It may be inaccurate for many. My sense from reading the work of social
scholars who study the LDS religion (e.g., Ryan Cragun and Jana Riess) is that
the majority of those who leave do so quietly.<sup id="fnref:leaving_quietly"><a href="#fn:leaving_quietly" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Some
experience a short phase where they are eager to share data and their new
worldview, but applying an observation that applies to some to the entire
group may be a form of survivorship bias—members only notice the ones who
were open and/or loud and fail to notice the many others who leave quietly
(because the ones who left quietly are not really noticed or observed).</p>

<h2 id="family-entanglement">Family entanglement</h2>

<p>Family entanglement.  Former member lives are often still impacted by the
culture and practices of the LDS Church. I have siblings and parents in the
Church, and may former members have children and spouses who still attend.</p>

<h2 id="political-entanglement">Political entanglement</h2>

<p>I live in Provo, Utah, so the LDS Church and its culture and policy impacts
political decisions and those decisions influence me, or my nation, directly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>[Gordon Smith discusses politics with LDS leadership]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4FPVZH8fIg)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="life-experience">Life experience</h2>

<p>I spent 38 years of my life (at this point ~83% of my entire life) as a
dedicated member. It frames who I am and how I think. Virtually all my
formative experiences were made from within the LDS framework. How do I even
interact with the world except from within that framework?</p>

<h2 id="positive-motivations">Positive motivations.</h2>

<p>Many former members feel like not knowing about the truth-claim data can cause
people harm. They felt compelled to leave after understanding the data, so
they think others deserve to know about it, also.  Few of them wish to compel
others to leave, they simply want others to have all the information to make
an informed choice.</p>

    <li id="fn:leaving_quietly">
      <p>This is my sense from reading their work. Cragun and Reiss who have done extensive research on the question of LDS membership rates, demographics, and other related questions. Quantifying this kind of thing is difficult, and I would love to better substantiate this point. <a href="#fnref:leaving_quietly" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
