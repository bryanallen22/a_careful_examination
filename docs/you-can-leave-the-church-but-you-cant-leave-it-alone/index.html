    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A common refrain heard when members of the LDS Church express when discussing those
who have left and are still vocal about the Church, its history, or its
culture is “You can leave the Church but you can’t leave it alone.”</p>

<p>The statement indicates that when a person leaves the Church they will
(likely?) continue to argue against (or at least be interested in) the Church.  At its most
innocuous, the statement may be viewed as neutral or value free—it is merely
an <em>observation</em> about the behavior of former members that they continue to be
involved in or concerned with LDS matters. However, LDS literature (official and unofficial) frequently discusses former member motivations, and these statements give clear insight into the likely <em>intended</em> meaning of the phrase.</p>

<h2 id="lds-perspective">LDS perspective</h2>

<h3 id="following-the-dictation-of-the-evil-one">Following the dictation of the evil one</h3>

<p>Official LDS literature includes an example of a member discussing how <em>they</em> would leave Mormonism alone and not attack it anymore, and this example is frequently repeated.<sup id="fnref:implication"><a href="#fn:implication" class="footnote">1</a></sup>  In this example, Joseph Smith responds to the individual claiming <em>they</em> would leave “Mormonism” alone by saying,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you [enlisted to serve God (by joining the Church)] you left the neutral ground, and you never can get back on to it. Should you forsake the Master you enlisted to serve, it will be by the instigation of the evil one, and you will follow his dictation and be his servant.’</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="guilt">Guilt</h3>

<h3 id="seeking-others-misery">Seeking others Misery</h3>

<p>The intended effect of using the phrase seems to be the marginalization the former member and their perspective: the <em>content</em> of a former member’s concerns or expressions can be more easily dismissed whole-cloth without considering their substance because the former-member is merely on “auto-pilot”—they literally <em>cannot</em> avoid attacking the Church.</p>

<h3 id="a-matter-of-degree">A matter of degree?</h3>

<h2 id="inaccurate">Inaccurate?</h2>

<p>It may be inaccurate for many. My sense from reading the work of social
scholars who study the LDS religion (e.g., Ryan Cragun and Jana Riess) is that
the majority of those who leave do so quietly.<sup id="fnref:leaving_quietly"><a href="#fn:leaving_quietly" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Some
experience a short phase where they are eager to share data and their new
worldview, but applying an observation that only applies to some to the entire
group may be a form of survivorship bias—members only notice the ones who
were open and/or expressive about their concerns and fail to notice the many
others who leave quietly (because the ones who left quietly are not really
noticed or observed).</p>

<h2 id="family-entanglement">Family entanglement</h2>

<p>Family entanglement.  Former member lives are often still impacted by the
culture and practices of the LDS Church. I have siblings and parents in the
Church, and may former members have children and spouses who still attend.</p>

<h2 id="political-entanglement">Political entanglement</h2>

<p>I live in Provo, Utah, so the LDS Church and its culture and policy impacts
political decisions and those decisions influence me, or my nation, directly.</p>

<p>Many LDS politicians are strongly influenced by LDS doctrine in how they
approach legislation. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>[Gordon Smith discusses politics with LDS leadership]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4FPVZH8fIg)</li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/spent-two-half-hours-david-130000672.html">David Farnsworth</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>My foundation is the doctrine of my church, and it flavors everything I do … I believe this is the word of God. I’m reading the Old Testament right now, three chapters every morning. Really enjoying it.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>… returning to the subject of the nondiscrimination bill. “It is contrary to our church doctrine,” he said, pointing to the church’s 1995 proclamation stating that marriage is between one man and one woman.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="life-experience">Life experience</h2>

<p>I spent 38 years of my life (at this point ~83% of my entire life) as a
dedicated member. It frames who I am and how I think. Virtually all my
formative experiences were made from within the LDS framework. How do I even
interact with the world except from within that framework, at least in some
significant ways?</p>

<h2 id="positive-motivations">Positive motivations.</h2>

<p>Many former members feel like not knowing about the truth-claim data can cause
people harm. They felt compelled to leave after understanding the data, so
they think others deserve to know about it, also.  Few of them wish to compel
others to leave, they simply want others to have all the information to make
an informed choice.</p>

<h3 id="brainstorm">[Brainstorm]</h3>

<ul>
  <li>informed consent, caring, leaving a burning building (or abuser)
processing a monumental life transition
    <ul>
      <li>if they love you, then they want to process that transition with you,
  somehow. Unfortunately, this often feels like a personal attack since the
  Church is tied into identity.</li>
      <li>countless life decisions were informed by their membership</li>
      <li>accepted the package of decisions and now are needing to grow into this
  new role very rapidly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>perpetual reminders</li>
  <li>not enough people who understand, so want to process with those who understand their
life experience</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<div class="footnotes">

    <li id="fn:implication">
      <p>The story of Joseph Smith’s response to Isaac Behunin, as recounted by Daniel Tyler (e.g., see <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-27?lang=eng">this lesson manual</a> is frequently conveyed in official LDS literature—a search on 2022-08-04 for the phrase “left the neutral ground” from the story retrieves 13 instances of its usage on churchofjesuschrist.org). The story begins with Isaac and Daniel visiting Joseph Smith and hearing Joseph recount among other things the “many false, inconsistent and contradictory statements made by apostates.” Isaac responded by saying that if <em>he</em> were to leave he would “go to some remote place where Mormonism had never been heard of, settle down, and no one would ever learn that I knew anything about it.” Joseph Smith responded, according to Tyler, by saying that in joining the Church Isaac had “enlisted to serve God” and “When you did that you left the neutral ground, and you never can get back on to it. Should you forsake the Master you enlisted to serve, it will be by the instigation of the evil one, and you will follow his dictation and be his servant.” Ben Arkell appeals directly to this story when discussing the idea that former members can leave but they can’t leave it alone in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220804203959/https://www.calledtoshare.com/2020/05/25/why-people-who-leave-the-church-cant-leave-it-alone/">this essay</a>. <a href="#fnref:implication" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:leaving_quietly">
      <p>This is my sense from reading their work. Cragun and Reiss who have done extensive research on the question of LDS membership rates, demographics, and other related questions. Quantifying this kind of thing is difficult, and I would love to better substantiate this point. <a href="#fnref:leaving_quietly" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
