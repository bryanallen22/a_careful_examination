    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In Elder Ballard’s <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/face-to-face/oaks-ballard?lang=eng">2017 YSA Face to Face</a> he stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re as transparent as we know how to be in telling the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that they as Church leaders had</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>never tried to hide anything from anybody</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in a <a href="https://www.thechurchnews.com/leaders-and-ministry/2018-09-10/what-elder-cook-and-historians-said-about-polygamy-seer-stones-and-church-transparency-during-nauvoo-face-to-face-8671">2018 Face to Face with Elder Cook</a>, Dr. Kate Holbrook added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Church did not hide information from me, but the historical information was not emphasized to me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At a broad-stroke level, perhaps these statements by Elder Ballard and Dr. Holbrook are pretty good characterizations.  I am not aware of that many clear-cut examples of where things were hidden from the body of the Church.  I am also inclined to give Church leadership the benefit of the doubt regarding their <em>motivation</em>, especially where we don’t have documentation indicating their motivation.  Intentional dishonesty can be very difficult to demonstrate in the historical record.<sup id="fnref:dishonesty"><a href="#fn:dishonesty" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>With that said, I think there are a few good examples of where the Church (or its representatives) appear to have failed to inform members of things they perhaps should have (i.e., they knew about things that are relevant to LDS truth-claims and they failed to make those readily available to investigators or the membership).  I am hesitant to label these “hiding.” <em>Hiding</em> can be seen as implying motivation and/or dishonesty.  I would rather just concede at the the outset that LDS leadership probably genuinely view their own actions as honest and honorable.  They might classify all of their actions as: 1) an honest mistake or ignorance 2) appropriate, 3) necessary to protect the innocent, 4) defending the faith, or 5) refusing to “cast pearls before swine.”</p>

<p>Still, I believe that agency is fundamentally precious and that a person cannot act with a full measure of agency unless the facts of the matter are accessible to them.  From that angle, then, I am less concerned with what the motivation of LDS leadership was when choosing whether to make information accessible than that information was not readily avaiable.  When leaders or institutions are transparent with the relevant data, then that allows others to fully exercise their agency, and I think we all applaud that.  When leaders or institutions fail to make relevant information accessible (whatever their reasons, even if noble) then this should probably be concerning to us because this can hinder a person in exercising their agency.</p>

<p>So many choices in our lives hinge upon which model we subscribe to, and which model we subscribe to is directly influenced by the data we have at our disposal by which to evaluate the strength of competing models.</p>

<h2 id="examples-of-failing-to-make-the-data-available">Examples of failing to make the data available</h2>

<p>These are some modern examples<sup id="fnref:modern"><a href="#fn:modern" class="footnote">2</a></sup> that I am aware of where LDS leadership or the institution appears to have failed to provide information (at least initially) that members or investigators arguably should have access to in making an informed decision about aspects of the Church or its truth-claims.</p>

  <li>
    <p><a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/1832-first-vision-account-suppressed/">The 1832 First Vision account was suppressed between 11 and ~30 years</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2012, when Stan Larson asked for access to Joseph Fielding Smith’s diaries to better understand the context and motivation for the 1832 account suppression discussed in the above point, <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/1832-first-vision-account-suppressed/#why-not-an-earlier-dating">he was denied access</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost since the beginning of the Church, the Book of Mormon translation process, especially with regards to use of the seer stone, seems like it could have been presented with greater transparency or accuracy.  Consider candidates <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/C32AVOh/deliberate-deception-related-to-the-seer-stone-pdf">in this presentation by japanesepiano</a>, many of which occurred relatively recently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Significant issues with Book of Mormon historicity were <a href="https://scholarworks.unr.edu/handle/11714/6712">made known to all of the LDS leadership in 1922</a>.<sup id="fnref:montez"><a href="#fn:montez" class="footnote">3</a></sup>  B.H. Roberts wrote up these issues in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_of_the_Book_of_Mormon">a series of long essays</a>.  LDS leadership could have published, made them available, or more widely circulated these studies.  And, when his descendants did try to get his scholarship published decades after his death, it is alleged by one of the contributors to the volume that the Church tried to suppress its publication (see <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/response-to-callister-bom-manmade-or-godgiven/#fn:mcmurrinsuppress">footnote #11</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wanting to test the merit of statements like Elder Ballard’s about transparency, I recently requested that the Church History Library point me to a complete list of resources held in their vault.  The librarian responded with some interesting information but <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/asking-what-is-the-complete-list-of-books-held-in-the-the-vault/">failed to provide a list</a>.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Bruce R. McConkie appears to have <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/bruce-r-mcconkie-misled-on-adam-god/">misled on the teaching of the Adam God theory</a>.  Also, consider Boyd Kirkland’s allegations in that same link demonstrating general suppression by LDS leadership of the idea that Adam-God was taught by Brigham Young.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>LeGrand Richards denied the existence of the seerstone <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/legrand-richards-denied-existence-of-seerstone/">in a 1978 interview</a>.  (may have been benign ignorance)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/05/09/new-collection-of-leonard-arringtons-vast-journals-shows-battles-the-mormon-historian-had-with-lds-leaders-over-telling-the-truth-about-the-churchs-past/">release of Leonard Arrington’s journals</a> (~2,700 pages) documents the “cancellation or censorship of work produced by Arrington and his stable of historians and writers.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gospel topics essays were deliberately released as part of an existing series so as not to draw the general membership’s attention to them (“soft rollout”). <a href="https://clyp.it/gq0cdhf1#">Recording of Steven Snow</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I performed a <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/how-transparent-was-lds-church-with-living-allowances/">fairly comprehensive analysis</a> of how the Church portrays living allowances for its senior male leadership.  A good example of how the Church has obfuscated living allowances can be found in <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/how-transparent-was-lds-church-with-living-allowances/#lds-newsroom-obfuscation">this section</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ellipses used in the Lorenzo Snow manual <a href="https://wasmormon.org/the-tithing-ellipsis/">changed the intent of Snow’s statement on tithing</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The D&amp;C and Church History manuals we used while I was growing up included <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MormonDoctrine/comments/9ava6z/the_two_institute_manuals_where_wed_expect_to_see/">very limited coverage of Joseph Smith’s polygamy</a>.  For instance, there is no mention of Fanny Alger and no mention that many of those Joseph had sealed to him were already married to other men.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When John Sweeney asked a direct question about the existence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strengthening_Church_Members_Committee">Strengthening Church Members Committee</a>, Michael Purdy appeared to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgKVCyGf-Ak">initially evasive</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elder Holland appears to have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9v2GxDs4To&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=80">attempted to mislead John Sweeney</a> when Sweeney was asking about Romney and the temple oaths he would have sworn.  Jonathon Streeter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPVpUJj_gbs">has analyzed this in depth</a>. [warning: potentially disturbing discussion of the temple and oaths]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elder Anderson may have misled Zimbabwe’s prime minister <a href="/a_careful_examination/we-are-not-a-wealthy-people/">regarding the wealth of the Church</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on Roger Clarke’s interview with the Wall Street Journal (as <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/02/08/lds-church-kept-lid-its-b/">reported by the Salt Lake Tribune</a>), it became apparent that LDS officials “kept the size of the church’s $100 billion investment reserves secret”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Church redacts sections of historical documents it otherwise makes publicly available, possibly because these sections cast leaders in such a poor light.  For instance, there are <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/brigham-young-q12-minutes-1847-12-09/">paragraphs redacted from John D. Lee’s disciplinary council</a> that D. Michael Quinn happened to transcribe before the redaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Gospel Topics essays sometimes use footnotes in a manner that poorly reflects (or maybe even reverses) the meaning of the original source material.  The most egregious of these is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uGbG1kvsluwiKvqrkQP7h7RocsrWC4cb/view">footnote #9 in the race and the priesthood essay</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe that’s not a very long list since it spans decades?  And perhaps we’d expect less transparency from similar organizations?  Regardless, it seems to me that there do exist at least a few instances where transparency fell victim to other concerns in the modern Church.</p>

<h2 id="remaining-questions">Remaining questions</h2>

<p>What responsibility does the organization have for presenting or publicizing unsavory, potentially damaging, or uncomfortable information to its members?  It seems fair to point out that the Church holds its members to exacting standards of honesty and transparency.  For instance, the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1994/10/thou-shalt-not-bear-false-witness?lang=eng">Ensign in 1994 taught</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can also be guilty of bearing false witness and lying if we say nothing, particularly if we allow another to reach a wrong conclusion while we hold back information that would have led to a more accurate perception. In this case it is as though an actual lie were uttered… Lying and misrepresentation in all of their forms are wrong, no matter how they may be rationalized, and those who silently let these evils pass unchallenged are also doing wrong</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other remaining questions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Should <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/the-church-does-not-apologize/">institutions apologize</a> for times they were not fully transparent?  Should the Church?</li>
  <li>If these are the instances we are aware of today, how many instances have still not been brought to light?  Can the Church “fully repent” as an institution without a full accounting?</li>
  <li>Can we say that the Church is fully transparent today?  What would they need to do to convince an unbiased 3rd party that was the case?</li>
  <li>Are the forces that initially fostered conditions where full transparency was not achieved still in place in the Church?</li>
</ul>

      <p>To be able to demonstrate dishonesty, a person typically needs to establish who knew what and when, and even then a case to establish motivation may merely be suggestive. <a href="#fnref:dishonesty" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:modern">
      <p>I am aware of probably just as many examples of the early LDS Church failing to be transparent as the modern Church, but this document is focused on the modern Church. <a href="#fnref:modern" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:montez">
      <p>My point in citing Shannon Montez’s masters thesis is to demonstrate that LDS leadership have known about potentially troubling issues with Book of Mormon historicity for a long time.  Montez concludes that B.H. Roberts probably did not believe in the historicity of the Book of Mormon towards the end of his life, but it is not clear if she grappled with the <a href="https://www.plonialmonimormon.com/2020/08/b-h-roberts-and-the-book-of-mormon-exhumation-and-reburial.html">data suggesting that Roberts may indeed have believed in a historical Book of Mormon</a>.  I personally think it’s difficult to decide the state of Roberts’s belief at the end of his life.  At the very least, these issues seemed a challenge to him. <a href="#fnref:montez" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
