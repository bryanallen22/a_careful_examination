    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In Elder Ballard’s <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/face-to-face/oaks-ballard?lang=eng">2017 YSA Face to Face</a> he stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re as transparent as we know how to be in telling the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and that they as Church leaders had</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>never tried to hide anything from anybody</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.thechurchnews.com/leaders-and-ministry/2018-09-10/what-elder-cook-and-historians-said-about-polygamy-seer-stones-and-church-transparency-during-nauvoo-face-to-face-8671">2018 Face to Face with Elder Cook</a>, Dr. Kate Holbrook added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Church did not hide information from me, but the historical information was not emphasized to me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At a broad-stroke level, perhaps these statements by Elder Ballard and Dr. Holbrook are good characterizations.  I am not aware of that many clear-cut examples of where things were hidden from the body of the Church.  I am also inclined to give Church leadership the benefit of the doubt regarding their <em>motivation</em>, especially where we don’t have documentation indicating their motivation.<sup id="fnref:dishonesty"><a href="#fn:dishonesty" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>With that said, the historical record supports several examples of when the Church (or its representatives) appear to have failed to inform members or investigators of things they perhaps should have (i.e., they knew about things that are relevant to LDS truth-claims and they failed to make those readily available or transparent), misrepresented the data, or influenced others to be less transparent in how its history was to be represented to the world and its own members.</p>

<p>Finally, it is worth noting at the outset that the Church has dramatically increased its transparency during the last two decades in many ways (e.g., the Joseph Smith Papers project and anticipated publication of the William Clayton journals).</p>

<h2 id="examples-of-transparency-failures">Examples of transparency failures</h2>

<p>These are some modern examples<sup id="fnref:modern"><a href="#fn:modern" class="footnote">2</a></sup> where LDS leadership or the institution appear to have failed to provide or attempted to hinder the availability of, information that members or investigators arguably should have access to (or admitted to such behavior).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1922</strong>  Failure to publicize issues with Book of Mormon historicity.</p>

    <p>Significant issues with Book of Mormon historicity were <a href="https://scholarworks.unr.edu/handle/11714/6712">made known to all of the LDS leadership in 1922</a>.<sup id="fnref:montez"><a href="#fn:montez" class="footnote">3</a></sup>  B.H. Roberts cataloged and explored these issues in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_of_the_Book_of_Mormon">a series of long essays</a>.  Arguably, LDS leadership could have published or made these studies more widely available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>~1930s–1963</strong>  Knowledge of the 1832 First Vision account was suppressed</p>

    <p>The 1832 First Vision account appears to have been <a href="/a_careful_examination/1832-first-vision-account-suppressed/">suppressed between 11 and ~30 years</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>~1970-1993</strong>  Arrington describes efforts to prevent ‘real’ history from being published</p>

    <p>In journals and diary entries, Leonard Arrington—first professional historian appointed as Church Historian—documented <a href="/a_careful_examination/leonard-arrington-and-real-history/">suppressive attitudes and actions</a>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>records “dissappear[ing] from scrutiny”</li>
      <li>“we are not required to tell the whole truth”</li>
      <li>“[LDS leadership] will not stand for our ‘real’ history”</li>
      <li>“want prophets without warts”</li>
      <li>“do not want the church to promulgate historical truth”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>~1973</strong>  Publication of Lester Bush’s research on the Priesthood Ban discouraged</p>

    <p>Lester Bush <a href="/a_careful_examination/lester-bush-research-on-priesthood-ban-discouraged/">has described the attitude of LDS leadership</a> related to his research and publication of Mormonism’s Negro Doctrine:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“the Church didn’t want every ‘Tom, Dick, or Harry’ looking through its records” [or even those with temple recommends]</li>
      <li>The vast collection of Manuscript History was off limits to Bush</li>
      <li>“My notes apparently were not evaluated for substantive questions, but rather from the perspective of what material had gotten out, and how.”</li>
      <li>“[The material showing Joseph F. Smith reversing his opinion on the ordination fo Elijah Abel] could undermine faith in his role as a prophet, so was inappropriate.”</li>
      <li>“if Dialogue prints Bush’s article the brethren will think that Dialogue is hostile”</li>
      <li>[after using the Bennion papers] “the Library was contacted in behalf of the First Presidency stating that we should not have copies of the councils’ minutes and requested [that the library] send them up [i.e., not make them publicly available]”</li>
      <li>“Mark E. Petersen … had spoken ‘very harshly’ about me over my publications… and instructed Marriott [Bush’s stake President] to call me in and take some appropriate action”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1978</strong>  LeGrand Richards denied the existence of the seerstone</p>

    <p>Elder Richards denies the existence of the seerstone <a href="/a_careful_examination/legrand-richards-denied-existence-of-seerstone/">in an interview</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1981</strong>  Bruce R. McConkie misleads about teaching of the Adam God theory</p>

    <p>Elder McConkie appears to have <a href="/a_careful_examination/bruce-r-mcconkie-misled-on-adam-god/">misled on the teaching of the Adam God theory</a>.  Also, consider Boyd Kirkland’s allegations in that same link demonstrating general suppression by LDS leadership of the idea that Adam-God was taught by Brigham Young.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1984</strong>  Speaking bans to limit the influence of “Mormon Enigma”</p>

    <p>Believing scholars Valeen Tippetts Avery and Linda King Newell published Mormon Enigma in 1984.  It won several Mormon history awards (including a BYU sponsored award).  Inquiries about Church sanction of the book prompted LDS leadership to ban Avery and Newell from speaking about Church history generally in LDS meetings.  When they finally were able to meet with the Apostles responsible for the ban, Newell noted their motivation.  As conveyed in <a href="https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V35N02_15.pdf">this Dialogue article</a>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>[Dallin] Oaks explained the decision to order the ban included the fact that “your book represents a non-traditional view of Joseph Smith” and thus may damage the faith of church members who read it. Linda explained that the letters and calls she had received from readers described a positive reaction. Oaks acknowledged that possibility yet maintained that he believed “the weight of the evidence was on the other side.”  Jack [Linda’s husband] countered that the issue was whether or not the book was an honest and true portrayal of the facts, readers reactions being incidental. When Linda asked whether the two apostles had read the book, [Neil] Maxwell did not answer and Oaks admitted he had only read portions of it, citing time constraints as the reason. He acknowledged that in what he had read, Linda and Avery had used restraint when discussing aspects of Joseph Smith’s life and his relationship with Emma. Apparently, however, it was not enough. After more discussion, Oaks emphasized that, despite his academic background and reputation as a scholar and intellectual, his duty as an apostle meant he had an obligation to “protect what is most unique about the LDS church” and stressed that “if Mormon Enigma reveals information that is detrimental to the reputation of Joseph Smith, then it is necessary to try to limit its influence and that of its authors.”</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>~1985</strong>  Attempted suppression of publication of Roberts’s Studies of the Book of Mormon</p>

    <p>When B. H. Roberts’s descendants tried to get his Book of Mormon scholarship published decades after his death, it is alleged by one of the contributors to the volume, Sterling McMurrin, that the Church tried to suppress its publication (see <a href="/a_careful_examination/response-to-callister-bom-manmade-or-godgiven/#fn:mcmurrinsuppress">footnote #11</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1993</strong>  Lavina Fielding Anderson is excommunicated for documenting LDS intellectual suppression</p>

    <p>Lavina Fielding Anderson published <a href="https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V26N01_23.pdf">a document</a> outlining ecclesiastical abuse of intellectuals in the Church.  She was excommunicated (as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_Six">the September 6</a>, intellectuals and feminists who were all excommunicated at about the same time).  She actively attended Church in the intervening decades and in 2019 her local and regional leaders recommended her for rebaptism to the First Presidency.  The First Presidency <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2019/09/05/writer-excommunicated/">denied the appeal</a> for re-baptism without comment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2001, 2003</strong>  Church manuals leave out difficult polygamy details</p>

    <p>The D&amp;C and Church History manuals include <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MormonDoctrine/comments/9ava6z/the_two_institute_manuals_where_wed_expect_to_see/">very limited coverage of Joseph Smith’s polygamy</a>.  For instance, there is no mention of Fanny Alger and no mention that many of those Joseph had sealed to him were already married to other men.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2011</strong>  Lorenzo Snow manual ellipses on tithing</p>

    <p>The ellipses used in the Lorenzo Snow manual <a href="https://wasmormon.org/the-tithing-ellipsis/">changed the intent of Snow’s statement on tithing</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2012</strong>  Gospel topics essays given a “soft rollout”</p>

    <p>In an undated recording, Elder Steven Snow describes <a href="https://clyp.it/gq0cdhf1#">how the gospel topics essays were released</a>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I think it’d be helpful to know how we chose to roll those out. It was a soft roll out. There wasn’t an announcement saying “You can go to this website to learn everything weird about the Mormon church you ever wanted to learn”. (Laughter from the audience) But yet we had a lot of people struggling with some of these issues. We were loosing young people particularly. And we felt we owed a safe place for people to go to get these answered. So they were deliberately kind of placed in an existing database, so they wouldn’t …. You know, 90% of the church probably couldn’t care less, they don’t worry about such things. But we do have some folks who are on-line and we felt like they needed a safe place to go to get answers if they had questions. So I don’t think you are gonna see a well publicised campaign to tell you to go to these sites.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2012</strong>  Denial of access to Joseph Fielding Smith’s diaries</p>

    <p>When Stan Larson asked for access to Joseph Fielding Smith’s diaries to better understand the context and motivation for handling and suppression of the 1832 account, <a href="/a_careful_examination/1832-first-vision-account-suppressed/#why-not-an-earlier-dating">he was denied access</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2012</strong>  Wickman portrays prop 8 efforts in California as primarily a grassroots effort</p>

    <p>In an interview conducted by Church media in 2012, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZzkeuR423k&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=57">Elder Lance Wickman stated</a>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>contrary to what some may think it was the members not the church, yes the First Presidency of the church sent a letter that was read in sacrament meeting urging members to get involved, and thats all that was needed and they were galvanized by it.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>However, a powerpoint presentation leaked to Mormonleaks called <a href="https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/index.php?title=File:Proposition_8_Grassroots_Program.pdf">Proposition 8 Grassroots Program</a> included detailed heirarchical organization charts and strategies suggesting the movement was directed and organized in top-down fashion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2012</strong>  Purdy evades question on SCMC</p>

    <p>When John Sweeney asked a direct question about the existence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strengthening_Church_Members_Committee">Strengthening Church Members Committee</a>, Michael Purdy appeared to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgKVCyGf-Ak">initially evasive</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2012</strong>  Holland misleads about temple oaths</p>

    <p>Elder Holland appears to have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9v2GxDs4To&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=80">attempted to mislead John Sweeney</a> when Sweeney was asking about Romney and the temple oaths he would have sworn.  Jonathon Streeter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPVpUJj_gbs">has analyzed this in depth</a>. [warning: discussion of the temple and oaths]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2013</strong>  Steven Snow admits the past tendency to prevent access to information</p>

    <p>Steven Snow recently <a href="https://mi.byu.edu/truth-in-church-history-excerpts-from-the-religious-educators-qa-with-elder-steven-snow/">stated</a>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I think in the past there was a tendency to keep a lot of the records closed or at least not give access to information. But the world has changed in the last generation—with the access to information on the Internet, we can’t continue that pattern; I think we need to continue to be more open.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2018</strong>  Anderson states “we are not a wealthy people”</p>

    <p>Elder Anderson may have misled Zimbabwe’s prime minister <a href="/a_careful_examination/we-are-not-a-wealthy-people/">regarding the wealth of the Church</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2018</strong>  obfuscation of living allowances</p>

    <p>I performed a <a href="/a_careful_examination/how-transparent-was-lds-church-with-living-allowances/">fairly comprehensive analysis</a> of how the Church portrays living allowances for its senior male leadership.  A good example of how the Church has obfuscated living allowances can be found in <a href="/a_careful_examination/how-transparent-was-lds-church-with-living-allowances/#lds-newsroom-obfuscation">this section</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2020</strong>  leaders did not want members to know about the size of Ensign Peak investments</p>

    <p>Based on Roger Clarke’s interview with the Wall Street Journal (as <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/02/08/lds-church-kept-lid-its-b/">reported by the Salt Lake Tribune</a>), it became apparent that LDS officials “kept the size of the church’s $100 billion investment reserves secret”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2013–2020</strong>  misleading footnotes in Gospel Topics essays and Come Follow Me Manual</p>

    <p>The Gospel Topics essays sometimes use footnotes in a manner that poorly reflects (or maybe even reverses) the meaning of the original source material.  The most egregious of these is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uGbG1kvsluwiKvqrkQP7h7RocsrWC4cb/view">footnote #9 in the race and the priesthood essay</a>.  Consider other examples discussed <a href="https://www.ldsdiscussions.com/footnotes">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1830–2020</strong>  seer stone usage misrepresentations</p>

    <p>Almost since the beginning of the Church, the Book of Mormon translation process, especially with regards to use of the seer stone, seems like it could have been presented with greater transparency or accuracy.  Consider candidates <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/C32AVOh/deliberate-deception-related-to-the-seer-stone-pdf">in this presentation by japanesepiano</a>,<sup id="fnref:candidates"><a href="#fn:candidates" class="footnote">4</a></sup> many of which occurred relatively recently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>present</strong>  First Presidency vault registers are not public</p>

    <p>As <a href="https://bycommonconsent.com/2017/10/21/the-william-clayton-diaries/">discussed by J. Stapley</a> (see his footnote#1):</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The materials archived by the First Presidency are outside of the purview of the LDS Church History Library and its registers are not public.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The FP vault has held items such as the 1832 First Vision account and William Clayton’s diaries, a person with book-keeping experience and Joseph Smith’s recorder and scribe for most of the Nauvoo period.  LDS Scholars are sometimes granted access to material in the FP vault, and from publication citations <a href="https://exploringmormonism.com/our-own-peek-into-the-first-presidency-vault/">a list of some items in the vault</a> can be assembled.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="motivation-and-consequences">Motivation and consequences</h2>

<p>Should we label these instances “hiding”?  <em>Hiding</em> can be seen as implying motivation and/or dishonesty.  Perhaps LDS leadership genuinely viewed their own actions as honest and honorable in every case?  A number of possible motivations may have been involved.  For instance, failures in transparency may be viewed as springing from:<sup id="fnref:motivations_overlap"><a href="#fn:motivations_overlap" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<ol>
  <li>An honest mistake</li>
  <li>Benign ignorance</li>
  <li>Some level of willful ignorance, but motivated by a focus on what are perceived as more important duties</li>
  <li>A desire to best represent the Church and its interests as a representative</li>
  <li>A desire to take necessary steps to protect the innocent or those immature in the faith</li>
  <li>A desire to defend the faith from those who would undermine it</li>
  <li>A desire to follow the various scriptural admonitions to be cautious in sharing sacred material</li>
  <li>A desire to wait until such time as a source can be properly understood and disseminated</li>
</ol>

<p>Those accounts which capture the motivation of leadership point to some of the above.  And, in general, leaders who were least transparent also seemed to view the institution and its truth-claims as under threat from forces set on undermining and perhaps destroying them.<sup id="fnref:sacrificing_transparency"><a href="#fn:sacrificing_transparency" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Generosity towards the motivation of LDS leadership should probably be balanced with an appreciation of the potential harms of limiting transparency where it might be due.  Individuals cannot act with a full measure of agency unless the facts of a given matter are accessible to them.  When leaders or institutions are transparent with the relevant data, then that allows others to fully exercise their agency.  When leaders or institutions fail to make relevant information accessible (whatever their reasons, even if noble) then this can hinder individuals’ self-determination<sup id="fnref:self_determination"><a href="#fn:self_determination" class="footnote">7</a></sup> and in selecting the best model among competing models.<sup id="fnref:models"><a href="#fn:models" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="responsibility-and-moving-forward">Responsibility and moving forward</h2>

<p>What responsibility does the organization have for presenting or publicizing accurate but unsavory, potentially damaging, or uncomfortable information to its members?  It seems fair to point out that the Church holds its members to exacting standards of honesty and transparency.  For instance, the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1994/10/thou-shalt-not-bear-false-witness?lang=eng">Ensign in 1994 taught</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can also be guilty of bearing false witness and lying if we say nothing, particularly if we allow another to reach a wrong conclusion while we hold back information that would have led to a more accurate perception. In this case it is as though an actual lie were uttered… Lying and misrepresentation in all of their forms are wrong, no matter how they may be rationalized, and those who silently let these evils pass unchallenged are also doing wrong</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other remaining questions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Should <a href="/a_careful_examination/the-church-does-not-apologize/">institutions apologize</a> for times they were not fully transparent?  Should the Church?</li>
  <li>If these are the instances we are aware of today, how many instances have still not been brought to light?  Can the Church “fully repent” (or make amends) as an institution without a full accounting?</li>
  <li>Can we say that the Church is fully transparent today?  How would we know if that were the case?</li>
  <li>Are the cultural forces that hindered transparency in the past still active in the Church today?</li>
</ul>

    <li id="fn:dishonesty">
      <p>Intentional dishonesty can be difficult to demonstrate in the historical record. To demonstrate it, a person typically needs to establish who knew what and when, and even then a case to establish motivation may merely be suggestive. <a href="#fnref:dishonesty" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:modern">
      <p>I am aware of probably just as many examples of the early LDS Church failing to be transparent as the modern Church, but this document is focused on the modern Church. <a href="#fnref:modern" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:montez">
      <p>My point in citing Shannon Montez’s masters thesis is to demonstrate that LDS leadership have known about potentially troubling issues with Book of Mormon historicity for a long time.  Montez concludes that B.H. Roberts probably did not believe in the historicity of the Book of Mormon towards the end of his life, but it is not clear if she grappled with the <a href="https://www.plonialmonimormon.com/2020/08/b-h-roberts-and-the-book-of-mormon-exhumation-and-reburial.html">data suggesting that Roberts may indeed have believed in a historical Book of Mormon</a>.  I personally think it’s difficult to decide the state of Roberts’s belief at the end of his life.  At the very least, these issues seemed a challenge to him. <a href="#fnref:montez" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:candidates">
      <p>Some of the examples seem better supported or more clear cut than others.  In addition, it is not always clear if leaders were acting to deliberately deceive or whether they themselves were working from incomplete or mistaken models of the translation process.  Regardless, it seems clear that the Church as a whole has struggled to be consistent and accurate in how it has dealt with the seer stone in at least a few instances among the candidates mentioned. <a href="#fnref:candidates" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:motivations_overlap">
      <p>Each of these motivations is not necessarily fully distinct from the others, and a given incident may invoke multiple motivations. <a href="#fnref:motivations_overlap" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:sacrificing_transparency">
      <p>Leaders and institutions tend to sacrifice transparency in proportion to perceived existential threats.  It is well established in the social science literature that perceived existential threats modulate hawkish or dovish stances (but sometimes <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01877/full">in nuanced ways</a>).  I take it as self-evident that hawkish stances tend to promote less information sharing (transparency) than dovish stances.  For instance, in wartime generals do not broadcast their army’s weaknesses to the opposition but in peacetime an organization may be more inclined to be transparent about its weaknesses with the hope that others will use that information for everyone’s benefit and in the process improve rather than seek to destroy the institution.</p>

      <p>The LDS Church also has some <a href="/a_careful_examination/three-fold-nature-lds-church-corporate-totalistic-individual-growth/">innate totalistic tendencies</a>.  For instance, totalistic groups tend to polarize individuals into in/out-groups (consider <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/how-those-who-leave-are-viewed/">how those who leave are characterized</a>), often perceive opposition as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4mH-2W5nbg">emanating from Satan</a>, and have a strong sense of devotion to a sacred and all-imporant cause.  All of these would seem to diminish an emphasis on transparency, especially if transparency would increase perception of potential weaknesses. <a href="#fnref:sacrificing_transparency" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:self_determination">
      <p>Transparency allows individuals to make choices for their lives with all the relevant data in hand.  For instance, in the late 1830s and 1840s thousands of recent LDS converts left their homes to immigrate to the U.S., but they did so under the assumption that the group was not practicing polygamy (based on <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/joseph-smith-polygamy-denials/">copious denials of the practice</a>).  Arguably, many would not have made the journey had they known the early Saints were engaging in non-traditional marriage arrangements. <a href="#fnref:self_determination" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:models">
      <p>So many choices in our lives hinge upon which model we subscribe to, and which model we subscribe to is directly influenced by the data we have at our disposal by which to evaluate the strength of competing models.  For instance, the 1832 first vision account <em>can</em> be viewed as indicative of an evolving theology of God’s nature, and the case for an evolving theology is probably weaker without the account. <a href="#fnref:models" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
