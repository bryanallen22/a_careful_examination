  <p>Adam, the first man, knew that he was a son of God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marion G. Romney. General Conference, April, 1973. <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1973/04/man-a-child-of-god?lang=eng">Man—A Child of God</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is held by some that Adam was not the first man upon this earth, and that the original human being was a development from lower orders of the animal creation. These, however, are the theories of men. The word of the Lord declares that Adam was ‘the first man of all men’ (Moses 1:34), and we are therefore in duty bound to regard him as the primal parent of our race.</p>

<p>As counselor in the First Presidency, Joseph Fielding Smith responded to a request for doctrinal clarification by Morris L. Reynolds.  <a href="http://www.utlm.org/images/curseofcain/curseofcain_p116appendixc.gif">Joseph Fielding Smith wrote</a>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The doctrine concerning Adam has been distorted.  You may accept what has been given us by revelation, and I call your attention to the Doctrine and Covenants.  In Section 29, verses 23 to 34, you will find some interesting information in relation to Adam.  It is also true that Adam being the first man, will eventually preside over his posterity as outlined in the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 107, verses 53 to 56, and in Section 78: 15-16, which are as follows:

"Who hath appointed Michael (Adam) your prince, and established his feet, and set him upon high, and given unto him the keys of salvation under the counsel and direction of the Holy One (Jesus Christ), who is without beginning of days or end of life." (Verse 16.)

<blockquote>
  <p>Of all the words they could have chosen to define her role and her essence, both God the Father and Adam called Eve “ the mother of all living “ – and they did so before she ever bore a child</p>
