Title: "Elder Bednar's time is too precious to be wasted on trivial
matters..."

Post:

> Elder Bednar came to my stake as a youth and provided a question and answer time. During this time a girls stood and asked "I just don't understand why women can't have the priesthood." Elder Bednar stared at her for a full minute or more in silence and I watched as she squirmed under his unsmiling gaze. He then turned and sat down. He leaned over and whispered something to the Stake President and the Pres stood up and said "Elder Bendar's time is too precious to waste on such trivial matters. I will answer this question and then Elder Bednar will return to answer the rest of the questions."

> At that moment I knew I was never to ask such a question. The girl was in tears as she sat down.

> At the end of the meeting everyone stood up after his "Apostalic Blessing" and began to buzz excitedly as they formed a line to shake his hand. Elder Bednar left the line and went to the podium and "rebuked our disorderly conduct after such a sacred ordinance". We were dead silent as the line was completed and we filed out for cookies of shame.
