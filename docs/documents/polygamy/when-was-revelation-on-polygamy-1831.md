The revelation on plural marriage was not written down until 1843, but its early verses suggest that part of it emerged from Joseph Smith’s study of the Old Testament in 1831. People who knew Joseph well later stated he received the revelation about that time.^4

Bachman, “New Light on an Old Hypothesis: The Ohio Origins of the Revelation on Eternal Marriage,” Journal of Mormon History 5 (1978): 19–32.

The revelation, recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 132, states that Joseph prayed to know why God justified Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and Solomon in having many wives.

The people referred to here are W.W. Phelps, Oliver Cowdery and five other men who received instruction for their mission to the Indians to take “wives of the Lamanites and Nephites, that their posterity may become white, delightsome and just.”

David J. Whittaker (a BYU scholar) in his [1985 Dialogue article](https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/uip/dial/article/18/4/33/242824) "Mormons and Native Americans: A Historical and Bibliographical Introduction" writes:

> In a revelation given in Missouri on 17 July 1831 Joseph Smith told these first missionaries to the Indians: "For it is my will that in time, ye should take unto you wives of the Lamanites and Nephites that their posterity may become white, delightsome and just, for even now their females are more virtuous than the gentiles." William W. Phelps included the 4 'substance" (two pages) of the revelation in a 12 August 1861 letter to Brigham Young, now in the Church Historical Department. Several things are apparent : ( 1 ) While the Book of Mormon strongly teaches that God removes the curse of the dark skin, this document implies that inter-marriage can; (2) Some scholars think that this revelation was the initial impetus for plural marriage, as some of the missionaries had wives in Ohio; and (3) This document seems to have begun the Mormon practice of marrying native Americans. Some of the contents of the document better fit an 1861 context and it is possible that Phelps added his own understanding thirty years later. Ezra Booth confirms early talk about marrying Indians, but the reasons for doing so probably did not include polygamy or even changing skin color, but rather facilitating entrance into the reservation for missionary work (Booth 1831; W. Hall 1852, 59; J. Brown 1960, 320-23; Brooks 1944; Coates 1972; Stenhouse 1873, 657-59; Bachman 1975, 68-73).

> Helen Mar Kimball was one of Joseph Smith’s plural wives, and her recollection in 1884 was that “The Lord revealed [plural marriage] to His prophet, Joseph Smith, as early as the year 1831.i Her memory was supported by two other plural wives Emily Partridgeii and Lucy Walker.iii These recollections may have referred to a revelation received on 17 July 1831 in which missionaries sent to preach the Gospel to Native Americans who had been resettled from the Great Lakes area to federal lands just west of Missouri. In this revelation, the missionaries were told, “For it is my will, that in time, ye should take unto you wives of the Lamanites and Nephites”.iv

> In 1869 Apostle Orson Pratt remembered that “In the fore part of the year 1832, Joseph told individuals, then in the Church, that he had inquired of the Lord concerning the principle of plurality of wives, and he received for answer that the principle of taking more wives than one is a true principle, but the time had not yet come for it to be practiced.”v Since the missionaries were already married, this revelation seems to have condoned their possible practice of plural marriage, although no such marriages occurred during their “Mission to the Lamanites.”
