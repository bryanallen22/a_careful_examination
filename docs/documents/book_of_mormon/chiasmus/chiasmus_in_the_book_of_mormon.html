<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Book of Mormon contains a large number of inverted parallelisms, today referred to as “chiasmus”, reminiscent of those found in the Old and New Testament.  At the time and for decades following their discovery in the Book of Mormon, it was thought that the idea of chiasmus in scripture would likely have been inaccessible to Joseph Smith<sup id="fnref:assumes_no_intuition"><a href="#fn:assumes_no_intuition" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.  Hence, their presence in the Book of Mormon is often touted as <a href="https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/chiasmus-book-mormon">evidence of an ancient origin of the book</a>.</p>

<p>However, the concept of “chiasmus”—along with its importance to ancient Hebrew scripture like the Old Testament—was somewhat recently found to have been in the proper time and place to have influenced someone like Joseph Smith in their production of the Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>In January of 1834, a mere four and a half years since completing the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith would acquire a copy of Horne’s second volume—the volume discussing inverted parallelism.  This underscores the idea that the book was known and known specifically by Joseph Smith to be of value.</p>

      <p>It is <em>possible</em> for a person intimately familiar with the Bible to intuit that kind of poetic structure through textual familiarity with an English translation alone.  However, arguments that chiasmus in the Book of Mormon is evidence of its ancientness assume that a modern translator would not have intuited this structure without previous exposure to the idea. <a href="#fnref:assumes_no_intuition" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
