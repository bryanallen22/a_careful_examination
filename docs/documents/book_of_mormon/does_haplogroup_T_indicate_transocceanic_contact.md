Donald Yates claims in [Anomalous Mitochondrial DNA Lineages in the Cherokee](https://www.academia.edu/9494507/Anomalous_Mitochondrial_DNA_Lineages_in_the_Cherokee) (self published in Cherokee DNA Studies: Real People Who Provied the Geneticists wrong) that a significant portion of Cherokee contain haplogroup T and because of the step-wise nature of the group, that this is evidence of a transoceanic dispersal.

There are a few problems with this claim:

1. The scientific study upon which the claim was made has never been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal.  Peer review and publication in a scientific journal is viewed by most scholars as a minimum bar for making credible scientific claims.  To date, the claim that haplogroup T supports a transoceanic migration event has not even reached the level of attention that geneticists have felt the need to address it (like they have done [with X2a](https://anthropology.ku.edu/cherry-picked-genetic-data-does-not-support-ancient-trans-atlantic-migration-professor-says)).
2. Yates appears to have zero years of formal academic training in DNA genetic analysis, although he is the owner of a DNA testing company.  His batchelor and masters degress are in English, his PhD in Classical Studies.  He was a part time communications professor and then an assistant professor for four years "teaching public relations, speech, and other communication arts courses" (from his [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donaldnyates/)).  Science is often performed by those with little initial academic training, but these individuals tend to eventually distinguish themselves through publication in peer reviewed journals (e.g., Zack Simpson was a high school drop out [who has co-authored a number of scholarly scientific studies](http://www.mine-control.com/zack/)).  As far as I can tell, Yates has authored or co-authored zero peer reviewed publications to date.
3. At least some individuals used in the study are from Cherokee groups which had such poor ancestral claims that [their petition for federal acknowledgement](https://www.bia.gov/as-ia/ofa/227-ctbdch-tn) has [been rejected](https://www.bia.gov/sites/bia.gov/files/assets/as-ia/ofa/petition/227_ctbdch_TN/227_fd.pdf) (incidentally, rejected by Larry Echo Hawk, an LDS General Authority at the time).

    > The petitioner’s own statements confirm the PF’s analysis of the evidence that Petitioner #227 is
a recently formed group of individuals from diverse origins who claim to have Indian ancestry,
but who have not documented those claims.
4. If we are dealing with a genuine genetic signature, an unbiased analysis of [993](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010070) and 650,000 SNPs demonstrates that [it is being absolutely dwarfed by many other genetic signatures](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/319/5866/1100.full) which all seem consistent with a land-bridge migration.  This doesn't nullify his research _per se_ (Yates was specifically seeking odd-ball signatures), but these other unbiased studies do undermine the standard narrative typically advanced in both official and unofficial LDS channels for nearly two centuries.

Note: The second of these points was compiled from a point [made here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2dltni/important_to_know_that_this_article_is_floating/cjqwnok/) (I believe it was made by /u/barefootcherokee, a Native American and former Mormon).
