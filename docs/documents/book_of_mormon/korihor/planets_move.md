[The Existence of God. A Sermon [on Exod. Iii. 14] Delivered at Bellingham (Mass.) ... October 13, 1816](https://books.google.com/books?id=rh9dAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA6&dq=%22existence+of+god%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiZk8ym5ZrkAhVKoZ4KHVKjBM0Q6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=%22existence%20of%20god%22&f=false)

There evidently appears to be design in the gen-
eral plan and system of the universe. All the va-
tious parts seem adjusted to cach other, and calcu-

lated to produce some important effect. The situ-
ation of the sun in the centre of our system, so that
it can communicate its light and heat to the bodies
that surround it, gives evidence that it must have
been produced by a designing and all-wise Creator.
Its being composed of materials which render it
capable of warming and enlightening those bodies
within the sphere of its influence, discovers the ex-
istence of design. Chance could never have been
the cause of the production of a body, the qualities
of which, as well as its situation, would render it
capable of producing so beneficial effects on the
objects within the reach of its operation. The sit-
uation of the planets around’ the sun, at distances
proper for receiving benefit from it, and in such
order as not to interfere with each other, affords an
argument collateral with the one drawn from the
relative situation of the sun. For, no doubt, the
mutual connexion between the sun, and the bodies
which compose the system of which that is the cen-
tre, gives evidence that they were designed to ope-
rate on each other in order to promote some valua-

ble end. The power of attraction, which is a qual-
ity of matter causing it to.tend to a common cen-
tre, and is found to belong to all matter, so far as
the research of man has extended, has an astonish-
ing influence on all bodies whatever. By it all mo-
tion of matter tending to a common centre is pro-
duced. Were this property of matter destroyed,
all order in our system would at once cease; for
then the planets, instead of revolving round the sun
as.a common centre, would fly off in every direc-

tion into the unknown regions of space. They
would then be completely out of the influence of
the sun, and consequently far removed from all the
advantages resulting from their revolving round
him as acommon centre. What we call our sys-
tem, would cease to be a system ; for there can be
no such thing as system where there is no order,
or general laws by which the whole may be gov-
erned.

In order further to illustrate this part of our argu-
ment, it is necessary to observe, that the attraction
of all bodies is as the quantity of matter, and in-
versely as the distances. The motion of the planets
is produced by two forces: the one that of attrac-
tion, the other a projectile force ; the former draws
them towards the sun, and the latter impels them
in a straight line. These two forces, operating to-
gether, produce circular motion, or, in most in-
stances, elliptical motion. How attraction can be

"a quality of matter operating so invariably, and pro-
ducing effects so astonishingly beneficial to the uni-
verse, is wholly unaccountable on any other princi-
ple than that of a designing cause. And it is equal-
ly difficult to account for projectile motion, unless
we suppose it to have commenced by the energy of
some being as capable of operating on matter as
the one we have supposed to be God. Were ei-
ther of these to be destroyed, as we have before ob-
served concerning attraction, direful effects would
ensue; or should they cease to operate in just pro-
portion, we are unable to calculate the mischief
that would immediately befal the system.

The whole science of astronomy goes directly to
prove the assertion, There is a God : 50 true is the
declaration of a no mean poet,

“An undevout astronomer is mad.”

Had a world been created with inhabitants, whose
wants were such that they could not be supplied by
any thing which the world would produce, infidcli-
ty might boast, with some more plausibility, that
this was not above the power of chance. But even
in this case, the existence of the world would con-
found them. Such, however, is not the fact. A
world has been created capable of producing every
thing suited to the convenience of its inhabitants.
This adaptation of means to ends discovers the de-
sign of something. It as obviously appears that
there is design in this adaptation, as in the case of
the watch, which we before mentioned. No very
nice coincidence takes place in any thing, without
its being observed as effected by some wise contri.”
ver. If the watch discovered the design of the
maker, why does not the globe discover the design
of a Maker ? The latter is as well calculated to an-
swer a particular purpose as the former. The di-
vision of the globe into oceans and continents is
wonderfully calculated to facilitate the intercourse
of mankind, and teach them that they are one great
family. Did not water exist in large bodies, the


communication between the different countries of
the world would be extremely tedious; and there
would be no such thing as an exchange of com-
modities among different nations. The inhabitants
of each section of the globe must subsist entirely
on the productions of their own particular spot.—
The mutual intercourse of mankind promotes, per-
haps as much as any thing, the civilization of the
world.

The animals which inhabit the various quarters
of the globe, are admirably calculated for the cli-
mates and productions of the parts where they are
situated. In the frozen regions of the north, where
man can scarcely find a scanty pittance on which to
support his miscrable existence, the rein-deer roams
the forests congealed in ice, the mountains covered
with eternal snow, and the cultivated fields little
better than either. Although the moss, on which
every other animal would die, is his only food, yet
he is so sumptuously fed with it, that he is possess-
ed of far more vigor than animals fed on the luxuri-
ance of torrid climes. Carry this most useful ani-
mal into more sultry latitudes, and he would first
decline, then expire, in spite of abundance. In the
burning regions of the torrid zone, the lion, the ti-
ger, and some other living creatures, have their ex-
clusive residence. No other climate is so conge-
nial with their natures; no other region is so well
calculated to afford them support: there they can
have full scope for the gratification of their vora-
cious desires. There, with a fury unparalleled, the
taging tiger has opportunity to slay and drink the

blood of thousands. While Providence has given
to smaller and less savage animals a remarkable fe-
cundity, it has provided this tiger to slay even out
of wantonness, to prevent the earth from being
overstocked with inhabitants. Had not this pro-
vision been made by design, it would be difficult to
account for it at all: indeed, it would be wholly
unaccountable. How suited is the ox, the lamb,
and numerous other animals, for the milder regions
lying between the tropics and the polar circles.

We might extend our remarks on the fitness of the
various irrational animals of the world to their re-
spective places of residence; but enough has been
said to show that design is obviously discoverable
in this fitness. The productions of the different
climates are not only calculated for the exigencies
of those animals which inhabit them, but the ani.
mals are furnished with instincts, which cause them
to distinguish the various kinds of food, and choose
that which is most suitable for their constitutions.
These instincts operate immediately on their enter-
ing the world ;_ so that such animals as range among
poisonous plants seldom experience any injury
from them. In treating on this part of the subject,
the fact, that the number of animals is adjusted to
the supply for them ; that there is none of the races
which become extinct ; and that the destruction of
animal life is in so exact proportion to the increase,
that no general dearth has, in scarce any instances,
taken place, ought not to be passed without notice.
The exact proportion between the males and fe-
males, is also worthy of attention. All these in-

stances give evident proof of design. ‘The man
who can believe all these things take place by
chance, is prepared to believe that two and two
make ten.
The structure of various animals, and particular.
ly of man, gives, perhaps, as indubitable proof of a
designing cause as any thing we can mention. Ev.
ery part of the animal system is calculated to pro-
duce some valuable effect. So that were we to take
a survey of the whole anatomy of the human body,
and that of the animal creation in general, we should
in every part find them adjusted to each other, so as
to produce the health of the system. We will
mention but one instance, and this shall be that
part of the system which consists in a power of
preparing food for digestion—the digesting faculty ;
and that by which the nourishment is distributed to
the body so as to supply its wants: all these mak-
ing one whole, will give us an idea of how much
design there is in the structure of man. In the first
place, the teeth are prepared, at the reception of the
food, to masticate it, and put it in a situation proper
for the gastric juices to have effect upon it: imme-
diately upon its reception into the stomach, the gas-
tric juices commence their operation, which pre-
pares the food to distribute its nourishment through
the vessels prepared to reccive and communicate it
to every part of the body. The vessels which im-
mediately receive the nutriment, convey it to the
blood-vessels, by which it is distributed through
the system. By observing other parts, we should

discover the same order through them all. It is
worthy of remark, that in no part of the economy of
human nature, is there any thing the design of
which is to produce pain; nothing which can,
when in its natural state, produce any of the disor-
ders to which mankind are incident: so far from
it, that these disorders all arise from. the various
parts getting out of repair.

The next proof which we shall exhibit is shown
from the existence and nature of spirits. Should it
be admitted that matter was eternal, (which is by
no means granted) still the existence of spirits
would not be accounted for. Universal experience
has taught the world that matter, when abstracted
from the operation of living causes, has no such
thing as thought attached to it; consequently,
thought cannot be produced by any modification of
matter. Hence, we infer that spirits must either
have been eternal, and, of course, self-existent, or
they must have been produced by some cause.
We know that some spirits are not eternal, because
we are conscious that we ourselves have not always
existed ; and that we have spirits, because we think
and are capable of action. We hence see that we
can account for our own existence in no other way,
than by supposing some spiritual being anterior to
human creatures, who was capable of producing ra-
tional beings, as well as ‘other things that exist.
The nature and powers of the human mind discov-
er divine wisdom: such capacities cannot have
their existence from chance. They give unequivo-
cal evidence of an intelligent Cause. Instead of the

arguments being exhausted, they continue to rush
upon us with resistless force. The apparent dispo-
sition of all things, or providence, discovers plainly
that there must be some being who presides over
the affairs of the universe. When we observe any
kind of machine, we, as stated. before, at once
conclude some intelligent being produced it. But
when we see that such machine is not only prepar-
ed for certain operations, and set in motion, but
also continues in operation for a great number of
years, we feel still more irrefragable proof that some
designing being must exist somewhere. So in the
case of our world: As the existence of the world
implies the existence of some antecedent cause,
so its continual preservation gives us still stfonger
proof that the cause is God. Were it possible to
conceive of the existence of matter and finite spirits
without a cause, that is, by chance, yet how there
should be so much order, beauty, and regularity in
all their operations, and all that order, beauty, and
regularity continued the same for ages, would be
unaccountable on any other principle but the belief
of the existence of an infinite Spirit. This infinite
Spirit must be capable of giving order and law to
whatever has being, and of continuing them at his
pleasure. In order further to illustrate and enforce
this argument, we shall produce a few instances, in

which the government of Providence is observable.

That the preservation of the just proportions in the

forces that produce the motions in the heavenly

bodies is dependent on a self-existent being, must
be evident to all who consider the absolute necessi-

ty of these forces being continued, and in -exact
proportion. But as some arguments, analagous to
this, have been made use of in another part of this
Discourse, we now dismiss it. The preservation of
all the various races of anitnals, ‘cannot be a casual-
ty. How the earth is kept in‘a situation fitted ‘to
produce food in all ages suitable for the sustenta-
tion of the same races, and those races prevented
increasing on cach other so as to destroy some of
the smaller kinds, cannot be rationally accounted
for, but by the supposition of an overruling Cause.
“he continuation of the nation of the Jews, asa

7 gt People, is an event equally difficult to be

- acited for. No other nations have been thus

’ » amidst a thousand persecutions. The preser-
_wdion of the church of God, when there were, to
hurran appearances, ten thousand chances for its
overthrow, furnishes an argument, in part connect-
ed with that arising from the continued preserva-
tion of the nation of the Jews; but still stronger.—
The existence of such facts is against the analogy
of nature in other things. But we forbear proceed-
ing farther on this branch of the subject, and pro-
ceed to introduce another argument.

This is drawn from the universal consent of
mankind. In every age, it has been the opinion of
men, that a Supreme Being exists. In the remo-
tést ages of the world, when it was yct in its infan-
cy, and its inhabitants ignorant barbarians, all be-
lieved there were gods. If, as some pretended phi-
losophers, inclined to universal skepticism, have

imagined, mankind were not fortwerly above the
brute ‘creation, and have been improving, though
imperceptibly, through a course of unknown ages;
they, nor any ‘one else, can assign any reason why
these semi-brutes should, in their first advances to-
wards reason, take it mto their heads that there
were superior beings, by whom they were made.
But that men the most ignorant and barbarous have
ever ‘had some notions of God, is demonstrable,
from the concurrent testimony of all history, an-
cient or medern, sacred or profane. This was the
opinion of Aristotle, of Plato, of Cicero, and others
in ancient times; they certamly knew of no people
who had not some notion of Ged. Mr. Locke has,
indeed, preduced:some antiquated evidence to'prove
that there are tribes existing which have no such
belief; but more recent voyagers have found no
place where the inhabitants have not some notions
of God, and rites of religious worship. It is be-
lieved by many, that Mr. Looke was too credulous
in admitting that there were people who had no idea
of God. But should it be admitted that there were
some obscure tribes, who had no conceptions of
God, it would not destroy the argument; for it does
not depend on the assertion that this belief is uni-
versal, but that it is general. The most refined, as
well as the most barbarous-of mankind, have -main-
tained the ‘belief of a God or gods. For who is ig-
norant that Greece, the cradle of the arts and sci-
ences, was overrun with gods? If any be ignorant
on these subjects, let him read the account of Paul’s
visit to Athens; there may be found an authentic

history of but a small part of their superstition.’ He:
frankly told them he perceived that in all things
they were too superstitious. He had, before this,
observed an altar with this inscription, “To the
unknown God.” Such was their attachment to re-
ligion, that they had probably determined to be out-
done by none. Rome was not less attentive to reli-
gion than Greece ; and their religious establishments
were founded on the belief of the people. Should
it be asserted that the wise men in these nations were
speculative atheists, it would as readily be denied.
They did, indeed, ridicule the polytheism of the
people ; and some, professing themselves wise, but
who were, nevertheless, abandoned wretches, pre-
tended to deny the existence of God. The really
wise were firm advocates for the doctrine of the
divine existence. .

But we shall proceed no farther with this, or any
other arguments; for it is believed enough have
been produced already to convince any one of the
truth of our proposition.

We have, in our introduction, observed that the
subject of this Discourse was a very important
one, as it stood at the foundation of all our be-
lief, or religious hopes. It is hoped that each one,
as we have passed along, has felt the importance of
the subject, and considered the arguments which
have been brought to establish its truth, From
the subject, as we have endeavoured to exhibit it to
your consideration, one or two inferences naturally
present themselves.

It will readily be perceived that there is a great
difference between beings who have a cause, and
those who have none. ‘That Being who has no
cause is eternal; but beings, who have causes, ar¢
finite in their existence. We, my hearers, are fi-
nite beings; God is an infinite Being. Herice we

' gee that there is an immeasurable difference between
the time that God has existed and the time we have
existed. This consideration ought to convince us
of the necessity and proptiety of our being impress-
ed with sentiments of awe and reverence, when we
contemplate on God. What a solemn silence per-
vades the soul, when at the foot of an ancient and
venerable precipice, from which rocks have been
precipitating themselves ever since the creation ?
What an awful horror seizes the spirit ! All the pas-
sions subside, apparently never to rise again! If a
stupendous part of the Creator’s works fills the
mind with such horror, what dread ought we to feel
in the presence of Him by whom they were form-
ed! Let us, my hearers, from these reflections,
think for one moment of our insignificance. It is
but a féw days since you and I began- to be; not
more than sixty or seventy years, at the longest.
But think of God: consider a moment, and inquire
if you can learn the time when HE begarr to be.
€an we find it? No. If we undertake to search
in the ancient periods of eternity for his beginning,
and think we approach towards it, still it recedes,
and recedes, and recedes. We ask the question,
long since asked by one divinely inspired—“ Canst_.
thou by searching find out God ?”

From the subject, we see the folly of those who
pretend to be atheists. They are either what they
pretend to be, or they are not. If they are atheists,
they are guilty of the most astonishing folly, in re-
sisting arguments amounting to demonstration. If
they are not what they pretend to be, what advan-
tage can they derive from such attempts at decep-
tion? They must be under the influence of some
wretched infatuation, similar to the profane swearer,
who deals out fire-brands, arrows and death, and
saith, Am I not in sport ?—-What advantage can it
be to any to be guilty of either? But why do I
talk thus? There are no atheists. Too long has
conscience held her iron sway over those men who
would, if they could, be atheists. Their own judg-
ments tell them their fears of God are well founded.
But notwithstanding I thus speak, yet it is too evi-
dent that many live without God in the world. How
will such men—how will you, my hearers, if you be
such men, (and we have reason to fear some of you
are) appear before that God, whose existence and
government your daily practice denies? I fear and
tremble for you, my hearers. I fear and tremble
for myself. Why amIsocold? Why do I feel
so little that I am in the presence of a God who has
eternally existed ?

Let us, on the whole, lay these things seriously
to heart, and profit by them. We are soon to die =:
We are soon to appear before God, whom we have.
offended. O let us be prepared for that time. That
this may be the case withgage@io@of.us, may God
grant, for the Redesy pias ) Phakic w.
