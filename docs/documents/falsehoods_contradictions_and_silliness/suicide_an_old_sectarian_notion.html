</header>
<p>This article discusses suicide and some potentially disturbing
doctrinal statements about suicide. If you are feeling suicidal, please

Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In a series of <a
href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900023523/lds-church-releases-new-videos-on-coping-with-and-preventing-suicide.html">recently
released videos by the LDS Church to address suicide</a>, Elder Dale
Renlund stated (emphasis added here and in all other quotes below):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s <strong>an old sectarian notion that suicide is a sin and
that someone who commits suicide is banished to hell forever. That is
totally false</strong>. I believe the vast majority of cases will find
that these individuals have lived heroic lives and that that suicide
will not be a defining characteristic of their eternities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First off, I think it is wonderful that the LDS Church is making (and
continuing to make) efforts to address the current suicide epidemic in
Utah and among younger individuals. Suicide is incredibly tragic, and we
all wish that it did not happen.</p>
<p>However, depending on how a person interprets the phrase “old
sectarian notion”,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> a listener might be surprised to
find that, at least to some extent, the LDS Church and its leaders
<em>in official channels</em> have long taught and implied that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>suicide is a sin</li>
<li>eternal damnation is a distinct possibility for those who commit
suicide</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="is-suicide-a-sin-according-to-lds-teachings">Is suicide a sin
according to LDS teachings?</h3>
<p>Suicide has been defined in official channels as “a very grievous”
sin and “a sin of great magnitude”.</p>
<p>M. Russell Ballard wrote in his 1987 Ensign article <a
href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/1987/10/suicide-some-things-we-know-and-some-we-do-not?lang=eng">Suicide</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I draw an important conclusion from the words of the Prophet:
<strong>Suicide is a sin—a very grievous one</strong>, yet the Lord will
not judge the person who commits <strong>that sin</strong> strictly by
the act itself. The Lord will look at that person’s circumstances and
the degree of his accountability at the time of the act. Of course, this
gives us no reason to excuse ourselves in committing sins, nor will the
Lord excuse us, if I understand correctly. We must constantly strive to
do our best in emulating the Savior in every aspect of our lives. At the
same time, however, let us remember that spiritual growth comes “line
upon line,” that the key—in the spirit world as well as in mortality—is
to keep progressing along the right path. …</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We cannot measure these particular spiritual experiences, of course.
We do not know the extent to which the door is open for these particular
people to grow and develop in righteousness until they possibly receive
the blessings of exaltation. <strong>They committed a very serious sin,
and some consequences of it may remain with them throughout
eternity</strong>. Only our Father in Heaven knows the full answer to
the questions our hearts ask regarding those who take their own
lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boyd K. Packer taught in the <a
href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/general-conference/1988/10/funerals-a-time-for-reverence?lang=eng">October
1988 General Conference</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>To threaten or to take life, even our own in suicide, is to
offend God, for He “in all things hath forbidden it, from the beginning
of man</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that <a
href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/sin?lang=eng">sin</a>
in the LDS view means to willfully disobey God’s commandments.</p>
<p>Apostle George Q. Cannon wrote in The Juvenile Instructor (<a
href="https://archive.org/stream/juvenileinstructor1993#page/352/mode/2up/search/juvenile+instructor">Volume
28, Pg. 352</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Funerals of Suicides. <strong>Anyone committing this crime should not
expect a public and honorable funeral</strong>. There is a wide
distinction between the condition of one who dies a natural death and
one who dies by his own hand. No one should be led to believe that
<strong>if he commits this sinful act</strong> he will still receive the
same respect and honor at his burial from the Priesthood and people of
God that others do who die as faithful members of the Church.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No encouragement of this kind should be given to anyone who has an
inclination to commit suicide. For this reason a person who commits
suicide should be buried privately and without ostentation, and
certainly the funeral services should be conducted without the
authorities of the Church lending their presence to the funeral. All
should be taught that <strong>it is a sin of great magnitude to take the
life which the Creator has given them.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cannon also wrote (<a
href="https://books.google.com/books?id=oxQxAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Volume
21, Pg. 275</a>) (and was quoted in the <a
href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/1987/10/suicide-some-things-we-know-and-some-we-do-not?lang=eng">October
1987 Ensign article</a> by M. Russell Ballard):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Man did not create himself. He did not furnish his spirit with a
human dwelling place. It is God who created man, both body and spirit.
Man has no right, therefore, to destroy that which he had no agency in
creating. <strong>They who do so are guilty of murder, self-murder it is
true; but they are no more justified in killing themselves than they are
in killing others</strong>. What difference of punishment there is for
the two crimes, I do not know; but it is clear that no one can destroy
so precious a gift as that of life <strong>without incurring a severe
penalty</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="banished-to-hell">Banished to hell?</h3>
<p>Latter-day Saints distinguish between Hell and damnation, and that
distinction is relevant to a discussion on suicide. The <a
href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/hell?lang=eng">“Hell”
gospel topic</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Latter-day revelation speaks of hell in at least two senses. First,
it is the temporary abode in the spirit world for those who were
disobedient in mortality. <strong>In this sense, hell has an
end</strong>. The spirits there will be taught the gospel, and sometime
following their repentance they will be resurrected to a degree of glory
of which they are worthy. Those who will not repent, but are
nevertheless not sons of perdition, will remain in hell throughout the
Millennium. After these thousand years of torment, they will be
resurrected to a telestial glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Second, it is the permanent location of those who are not redeemed by
the Atonement of Jesus Christ. In this sense, hell is permanent. It is
for those who are found “filthy still” (D&amp;C 88:35, 102). This is the
place where Satan, his angels, and the sons of perdition—those who have
denied the Son after the Father has revealed Him—will dwell
eternally</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Renlund fails to mention that <em>anyone</em> who doesn’t eventually
reject the Savior’s Atonement will <em>eventually</em> be pulled from
Hell, and since that also goes for pedophiles, serial killers, and
rapists, this perhaps isn’t as comforting as it may sound at first.</p>
<p>What Latter-day Saints perhaps fear most is damnation—the fear that
they will remain separated from God and family <em>forever</em>. The
Guide to the Scriptures topic on <a
href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/gs/damnation?lang=eng">damnation</a>
states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The state of being stopped in one’s progress and denied access to the
presence of God and His glory. Damnation exists in varying degrees.
<strong>All who do not obtain the fulness of celestial exaltation will
to some degree be limited in their progress and privileges, and they
will be damned to that extent.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="exaltation-logic">Exaltation logic</h3>
<p>LDS doctrine strongly implies that those who commit suicide will not
obtain exaltation. The logic is simple and the pieces are ubiquitously
taught:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We must strive to keep the commandments in order to be
exaltated.</li>
<li>Suicide is a “grievous sin” (as previously demonstrated)</li>
<li>This life is the time to prepare to meet God (See Alma
34:32:35)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Gospel Principles manual is very clear as to what is required to
obtain exaltation. Quoting Joseph Fielding Smith, it states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to obtain the exaltation we must accept the gospel and all
its covenants; and take upon us the obligations which the Lord has
offered; and <strong>walk in the light and the understanding of the
truth; and ‘live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of
God’</strong> (Doctrines of Salvation, 2:43).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As demonstrated above, official Church material defines suicide as a
grievous sin.</p>
<p>And finally, LDS leaders are quick to quote the Book of Mormon where
Amulek states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>32 For behold, <strong>this life</strong> is the time for men to
prepare to meet God; yea, behold <strong>the day of this life is the day
for men to perform their labors</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>33 And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many
witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you <strong>that ye do not
procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end</strong>; for
after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity,
behold, <strong>if we do not improve our time while in this life, then
cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor
performed</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>34 <strong>Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis,
that I will repent, that I will return to my God</strong>. Nay, ye
cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at
the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power
to possess your body in that eternal world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>35 For behold, <strong>if ye have procrastinated the day of your
repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the
spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his</strong>; therefore, the
Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you,
and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of
the wicked.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="killing-logic">Killing logic</h3>
<p>The logic that a person who commits suicide cannot be exalted based
on having killed is also similarly simple:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Those who commit suicide have killed (i.e., they killed
themselves).</li>
<li>Those who kill will not receive forgiveness in the life to come</li>
</ol>
<p>Is suicide killing? The Apostle George Q. Cannon in <a
href="https://books.google.com/books?id=oxQxAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">The
Juvenile Instructor, Volume 21, Pg. 275</a> taught (also quoted in the
<a
href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/1987/10/suicide-some-things-we-know-and-some-we-do-not?lang=eng">October
1987 Ensign article</a> by M. Russell Ballard):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Man did not create himself. He did not furnish his spirit with a
human dwelling place. It is God who created man, both body and spirit.
Man has no right, therefore, to destroy that which he had no agency in
creating. <strong>They who do so are guilty of murder, self-murder it is
true; but they are no more justified in killing themselves than they are
in killing others</strong>. What difference of punishment there is for
the two crimes, I do not know; but it is clear that no one can destroy
so precious a gift as that of life <strong>without incurring a severe
penalty</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, D&amp;C 42:18 states in the voice of the Lord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And now, behold, I speak unto the church. Thou shalt not kill; and he
that kills shall not have forgiveness in this world, nor in the world to
come.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="other-statements-on-suicide-damnation">Other statements on
suicide damnation</h3>
<p>LDS leaders tend to speak with some ambiguity about the eternal fate
of individuals, but the idea that someone who commits suicide may not be
eligible for exaltation in the Celestial Kingdom has been somewhat
pervasive in both official and unofficial venues. For instance, Joseph
F. Smith <a
href="https://archive.org/details/conferencereport1907sa">taught in the
October 1907 General Conference</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You cannot take a murderer, <strong>a suicide</strong>, an adulterer,
a liar, or one who was or is thoroughly abominable in his life here, and
simply by the performance of an ordinance of the Gospel, cleanse him
from sin and usher him into the presence of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when a person was “demented”, the First Presidency still decided
that they could not be clothed in Temple robes, which suggests
separation from God. From the <a
href="https://www.churchhistorianspress.org/george-q-cannon/1890s/1894/06-1894?lang=eng">Journal
of George Q. Cannon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friday, June 29, 1894 A dispatch was received by the First Presidency
from the south this morning, asking whether a suicide—<strong>a man who
was demented</strong>—could be buried in his Temple clothes. <strong>We
decided that it would be improper for him to be clothed in his Temple
robes</strong>. I feel that we should set our faces against the crime of
suicide and withhold honorable burial from everyone who resorts to this
method of destruction. It should be made odious as far as possible in
the eyes of the people, and I have felt stirred up at different times by
seeing the disposition on the part of many people to pay respect and
give honorable funerals to persons guilty of this crime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In characteristic style, Bruce R. McConkie lays out what he views is
the <a
href="https://reasonableanswersdownloads.s3.amazonaws.com/Mormon+Doctrine.pdf">Mormon
Doctrine</a> (pg. 21 under the entry “Agency”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Agency, of course, is exercised in accordance with law. Once a final
choice has been made, there is noturning back to seek the opposite goal.
Men may exercise their agency to repent and turn to the Lord in this
life, in which event they will be saved. <strong>But if they choose to
rebel against the light and work wickedness, they will be damned. And
once they are damned, there is no power of choice left whereby they can
alter their course and gain salvation. If men choose to commit suicide,
for instance, they will continue to have agency in hell, but they will
not be able to use it to gain their lives back again.</strong> The
purpose of this life is to test men, to see if they will take the bodies
which have been given them, and by the righteous exercise of agency make
those bodies fit abodes for the Spirit of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, note that Elder Ballard wrote in the 1987 Ensign article on
suicide that “<strong>[t]hey committed a very serious sin, and some
consequences of it may remain with them throughout
eternity</strong>”.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Renlund may be right that the idea that “suicide is a sin and that
someone who commits suicide is banished to hell forever” is an old
sectarian notion—few will take issue with that fact. Still, in choosing
to label these ideas “old sectarian notions” he has potentially<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> deflected attention from numerous
official and unofficial LDS teachings which also point to such
conclusions. Official LDS material defines suicide as a “grievous sin”,
the logic of exaltation and the logic on killing both hint or imply that
those who commit suicide will not partake in exaltation, and much has
been written in official and unofficial channels which supports this
conclusion.</p>
<p>So, while the emphasis on suicide prevention is admirable and should
be continued, shunting responsibility for attitudes about suicide with
the obscuring phrase “old sectarian notions” rather than directly
dealing with LDS logic and statements on the matter may still be missing
the mark and can easily be viewed as a mild form of gaslighting those
whose attitudes about suicide have been derived primarily through LDS
channels.</p>

However, since the word “sectarian” <em>may</em> be viewed more broadly
as also encompassing the LDS Church and not necessarily excluding it
(i.e., the LDS Church is a “sect”, broadly speaking, it can be argued)
it is possible that he intended the phrase to indicate the inclusion of
the Church, also. If that were the case, it would have been much more
clear were he to have stated something like, “There is an old notion,
