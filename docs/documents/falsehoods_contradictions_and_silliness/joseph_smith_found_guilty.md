It is sometimes argued that Joseph Smith was never found guilty of any of the charges he was brought to court for.  This is a BYU Studies article admitting he was found guilty on at least one occasion.

Dale W. Adams, [Chartering the Kirtland Bank](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/chartering-kirtland-bank), BYU Studies 23:4, 1983, 
> A month after the bank opened a writ was sworn out against Joseph Smith, Jr., and Sidney Rigdon by Samuel D. Rounds, a front man for Grandison Newell.[16] The writ accused the two Mormon leaders of illegal banking and issuing unauthorized bank paper. A hearing on 24 March 1837 postponed the trial on this case until the fall session of the court. At the jury trial in October 1837, **Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon were found guilty and fined $1,000 each plus some court costs, a fine they appealed**.[17] A flurry of law suits, charges, countercharges, arrests, and threats of arrests swirled around the founders of the bank from March through December.  The storm abated only when many of the founders of the bank and principal Church leaders fled Kirtland in 1837 and 1838.
