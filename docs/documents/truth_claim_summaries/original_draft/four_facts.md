To me, these are the 4 most important evidences suggesting that the Church is not what it claims to be.  I've included the best apologetic arguments of which I am aware in the "Pro-Mormon" section following each point.

Please let me know if you find any mistakes, mis-representations, better counter-arguments, or any better counter-evidence, and I will update this document.  When dealing with diverse opinions---especially on difficult topics---I always want to represent others' arguments to their satisfaction.

## 1. The 3rd facsimile is incorrectly translated

Joseph Smith mis-translated [the characters above the heads of the figures in facsimile 3](https://i.imgur.com/2a5sban.png).

Joseph refers to the characters in specific locations on facsimile 3 and he gives a translation.  The translation is incorrect.

### Discussion:

The Church acknowledges that a straightforward translation of the papyrus fragments now in the Church's possession does not produce the text of the Book of Abraham (see Book of Abraham essay, linked below).  However, some Latter-day Saint scholars still hold that the Book of Abraham could have been recorded on a longer scroll that was never recovered (although good evidence suggests [the scroll we now have is the scroll Joseph Smith used for translation](https://mormonbandwagon.com/files/2015/10/1789365821_word_image.png)).  Regardless, the 3rd facsimile offers a direct test---we know from it that Joseph Smith did not translate these documents in an objective way.

**Pro-Mormon**:

The argument against criticisms like this is that Joseph was translating in a very loose way a document that has been lost to history but which is preserved in the echoes of what is recorded on the papyrus.  A few correspondences to concepts from the ancient world support the idea that the Book of Abraham is objectively derived from an ancient source.

## 2. The Book of Mormon bears the imprint of its time

The Book of Mormon is a tremendous book and contains many profound insights
and ideas.  Still, most Latter-day Saints are unaware of the evidence that the
Book of Mormon may be partially or entirely a product of Joseph Smith's day.

### Similar to books and preaching of its time

Pro-Mormon historian Richard Bushman recently observed:

> The Book of Mormon has a lot of nineteenth-century Protestant material in it, both in terms of theology and of wording. I am looking for an explanation of how and why it is there. ([source](http://www.wheatandtares.org/17915/richard-bushman-on-mormonism/))

The Book of Mormon contains an immense number of ideas and phrases common to the early nineteenth century.  Here are two of *many* similarities:

* There are many points of similarity [with the sermons of Jonathon Edwards Jr. and Sr.](https://imgur.com/a/q2AcO)
* The book "The Late War", by Gilbert Hunt, is [very similar to the Book of Mormon in style and content](https://wordtreefoundation.github.io/thelatewar/).  It contains [extensive chiastic structures](https://wordtreefoundation.github.io/thelatewar/chiasmus_the_late_war.png), like the Book of Mormon, and it also contains many [similar Hebraisms](https://wordtreefoundation.github.io/thelatewar/#hebraisms).

### Discussion:

A tremendous effort has been made to understand the Book of Mormon as an ancient American document (see links below).  Still, many features do not correspond well with ancient American cultures (e.g., horses, chariots, wheat, and barley) and require contortion of the plain meaning of the text to achieve correspondence.  Joseph Smith likely did not directly *plagiarize* existing works.  However, the imprint of the early 1800's is heavy upon the book suggesting that some or all of the book is best accounted for through transfer from Joseph Smith's milieu.

**Pro-Mormon**:

The defense against parallels found in Joseph Smith's own milieu follows three
lines of thought: 1) some ideas common to the 1800's are also of more ancient origin
; 2) Joseph Smith clothed ancient American concepts in language from his own
time; and/or 3) ideas that would resonate with people from the 1800s were
revealed to the ancient authors of the Book of Mormon and/or revealed to
others from the 1800s.

## 3. Spiritual confirmations common to many faiths

Members interpret spiritual experiences as a confirmation that their faith is true.  But [these confirmations are common to members of *many* faiths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJMSU8Qj6Go) (e.g., Judaism, Catholicism, Seventh Day Adventist, Scientology, Islam, and Divine Truth).

### Discussion

The manner in which Latter-day Saints use spiritual experiences to confirm the truth of religious claims is common to many religious and quasi-religious groups, many of which espouse ideas that directly contradict fundamental Gospel principles.  Determining the validity of truth claims using spiritual experiences, while beautiful in theory, seems unreliable in practice.

* [Thought-reform patterns](http://www.exitsupportnetwork.com/artcls/mindctrl/lifton.htm). (The Church is not extreme in how it applies any given method, but it follows the general pattern of totalistic groups)

**Pro-Mormon**:

Those from other faiths who experience spiritual experiences suggesting to
them that their faith is true may be misprepresenting the experience or mis-interpreting
the meaning of the experience.  In addition, it is difficult to quantify and
compare the intensity and penetrance (i.e., the percentage of people
experiencing the phenomenon) of spiritual experiences between people of
different faiths.

## 4. Joseph Smith's polygamy violates ethical and theological principles

In a recent interview, the most faithful LDS apologists on polygamy recounted, "At the end of the book [the book reviewer] didn't get a warm fuzzy feeling and that's not really something we think we can deliver with this topic."  And from earlier, "[a book reviewer says] Joseph Smith has still practiced polygamy.  And that's something that we can't make go away.  We wish that we could."

* Joseph frequently misled others about practicing polygamy.  Mormon apologist Brian Hales [agrees with Fawn Brody](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/common-questions/polygamy-denials/): "The denials of polygamy uttered by the Mormon leaders between 1835 and 1852, when it was finally admitted, are a remarkable series of evasions and circumlocutions involving all sorts of verbal gymnastics."
* Joseph was [sealed twice to the Partridge sisters](http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/mormonhistory/vol34/iss3/) in order to hide the first sealing from Emma.  He had been sealed to [over 20 wives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Joseph_Smith%27s_wives) before he was sealed to Emma.
* Joseph promised a 14 year old girl---one who had seen her mother's trials in polygamy and said "[I hated polygamy with my heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Mar_Kimball)"---that marrying him would "[secure salvation  and exaltation & that of your father’s household & all of your kindred](https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/no-weapon-shall-prosper/subject-can-bear-investigation-anguish-faith-and-joseph-smiths)".  Joseph was already married [to over two dozen women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Joseph_Smith%27s_wives).
* Joseph convinced a seven month pregnant mother, Zina Huntington (happily newlywed to Jacob Huntington) to marry Joseph [by saying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zina_D._H._Young) that he had "put it off till an angel with a drawn sword stood by me and told me if I did not establish that principle [plurality of wives] upon the earth I would lose my position and my life."  Joseph had [*already* married 3 other women besides Emma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Joseph_Smith%27s_wives).

## Conclusion

### All the other issues

I've tried to concisely lay out what I see as the 4 most important issues, but there are a many other serious issues that deserve consideration.  I think it's fair to weigh the sum total of evidence, for and against, in deciding how well the Church's truth-claims stand up to critical analysis.

### The Benefit of the Doubt

I enthusiastically agree that it is possible for a person to sustain faith in
the Church by down-playing all critical issues and giving Joseph Smith and the
Church the full benefit of the doubt (I did this for many years).  However,
such generosity of belief would enable a person to sustain faith in *any*
organization asking its members to suppress doubt in its truth-claims.  In the
same manner that I could sustain faith in the truth claims of the Church I
could also sustain belief in the claims of the [7th Day
Adventists](http://www.ellenwhitedefend.com/), the [Jehovah's
Witnesses](http://www.amazon.com/Jehovahs-Witnesses-Defended-Scholars-Critics/dp/0965981479),
or in [Christopher Nemelka's sealed portion of the Book of
Mormon](http://marvelousworkandawonder.com/tsp/index.htm).  To me, this level
of generosity in belief goes too far since it would result in a highly
incoherent world-view--I would have to accept many clearly contradictory
claims if I were too eager to ignore the evidence against a religion's
truth-claims.
