## My Family's Dedication to the Gospel

The family I grew up in was highly faithful to the Church way of life (not perfect, of course, but actively striving).  A few examples:

* We either woke up early for family scripture study or my mom would read scriptures to us at the table growing up fairly regularly.
* We regularly held family home evening (probably > 75% of the time).
* We typically watched every session of conference.
* Our family invited people over for missionary discussions growing up.  I helped to convert a friend to the faith when I was in high school, and one of my younger brothers converted his friend.
* Every one of the many children in my family graduated from BYU.
* Every one of the many boys in my family served to completion an LDS mission (and all were effective and diligent as far as I am aware).
* We never watched TV on Sunday.
* My mom always told us stories about forgoing social activities to attend sparsely attended Church activities.
* My mom always told us about how my older brother was thirsty after his game but all they were serving was Coke, so he just went thirsty.
* My grandparents served many missions and also served as a mission president.  My grandmother served a mission.  My parents served a mission immediately upon retirement and are currently serving as service missionaries.
