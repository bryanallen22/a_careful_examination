> As a teenager I remember attending a fireside where Elder Paul H. Dunn spoke about his experiences as a soldier during WWII and as a baseball player for the St Louis Cardinals. These same stories appeared in Dunn’s 50+ books and inspirational cassette tapes. While reading and listening to many of these I remember distinctly receiving several spiritual witnesses verifying that what he was saying was true. At least that is how I interpreted it at the time.  These were among the first spiritual witnesses I experienced as a youth. Elder Dunn’s stories elicited very strong emotions within me that set the standard for all subsequent “spiritual witnesses” that came later.  

> When I learned about Dunn’s contrived stories about three years ago, all sorts of questions and thoughts flooded into my mind such as: How could I receive a spiritual witness of the truthfulness of a complete fabrication? Was I manufacturing my own epiphanies to satisfy my strong desires to fit into a social organization? Was I receiving a witness of the principal taught rather than the authenticity of the story? Are these “burning-in-the bosom” emotions based on one’s desire for something to be true, rather than actual truth?  

> Throughout my life I have received the same kind of feelings/emotions/spiritual witnesses as those received with Elder Dunn’s stories. If I am unable to trust the “feelings” I received with Elder Dunn’s fabrications, then neither can I trust those same “feelings” I have received since then as far as absolute truth is concerned.  I still believe each individual receives “higher”guidance for them personally, however, it is not to be applied to anyone or anything else. Example:  Because one receives a good feeling that charity is a worthwhile principle, that does not mean that because charity is spoken of in the Bible or Book of Mormon that that is an indication that both those books come from God.  One has nothing at all to do with the other.
