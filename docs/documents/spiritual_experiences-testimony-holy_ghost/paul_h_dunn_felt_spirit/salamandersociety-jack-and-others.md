> How many of you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that Paul H. Dunn's stories were true?

> Admit it. During your TBM (True Believing Mormon) days, when you heard a faith promoting Paul H. Dunn story, you felt a lump in your throat, a burning in your bosom, and you knew that the spirit was testifying to you the truthfulness of Brother Dunn's story. When he was exposed as a teller of 'inspired fiction' how did you explain the spirit that you felt? My TBM defenses shot up and I told myself that even if his stories weren't exactly true, that wasn't important. What was important was that his stories were spiritual and inspirational and strengthned my testimony as well as others, and because of that, I forgave Paul Dunn and felt he was being unjustly persecuted. Man was I brainwashed.
