> The interesting thing to me in all this is how many of us said we felt the Spirit when Dunn spoke. He was a favorite with missionaries and members alike. I cannot tell you how many people said they felt the Spirit and were so inspired by his talks.What does this say about the Spirit as a precise measure of truth?
