  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Some theories for Book of Mormon authorship invoke co-authors instead of Joseph (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utDU45lm210&amp;list=PLCC85CE4017A42CE3">Criddle</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC4u6lOQONs&amp;list=PL09606347D9096CB6">Hancock</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf3MluItWQE&amp;t=35s">Trebas</a>), but other scholars (e.g., <a href="https://www.mormonstories.org/podcast/book-of-mormon-dan-vogel/">Dan Vogel</a> and Brent Metcalfe [facebook communication]) maintain that Joseph Smith was primarily responsible for creating the Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>Was Joseph Smith capable of such a feat?</p>

<h2 id="own-statements">Own statements</h2>

<p>In his earliest history, <a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-summer-1832/2">Joseph smith wrote</a> (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was born in the town of Charon [Sharon] in the State of Vermont North America on the twenty third day of December AD 1805 of goodly Parents <strong>who spared no pains to instructing me in the christian religion</strong>. at the age of about ten years my Father Joseph Smith Seignior moved to Palmyra Ontario County in the State of New York and being in indigent circumstances were obliged to labour hard for the support of a large Family having nine chilldren and as it required the exertions of all that were able to render any assistance for the support of the Family <strong>therefore we were deprived of the bennifit of an education suffice it to say I was mearly instructtid in reading writing and the ground rules of Arithmatic which constituted my whole literary acquirements. **At about the age of twelve years</strong> my mind become seriously imprest with regard to the all importent concerns for the wellfare of my immortal Soul which <strong>led me to searching the scriptures</strong> believeing as I was taught, that they contained the word of God thus applying myself to them and <strong>my intimate acquaintance with those of differant denominations</strong> led me to marvel excedingly for I discovered that they did not adorn their profession by a holy walk and Godly conversation agreeable to what I found contained in that sacred depository this was a grief to my Soul thus <strong>from the age of twelve years to fifteen I pondered many things in my heart concerning the sittuation of the world of mankind the contentions and divisions the wickedness and abominations and the darkness which pervaded the minds of mankind my mind become excedingly distressed for I become convicted of my sins and by searching the scriptures I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that they had apostatised from the true and liveing faith</strong> and there was no society or denomination that built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the new testament and I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, while Joseph clearly emphasizes that he had little formal schooling, he also emphasizes in several places how familiar he was with the scriptures and the religious arguments of the day.  If Joseph continued that trajectory of interest in scripture and religion, then we can put an upper bound on his intense scripture/religion searching at 11 years.</p>

<h2 id="emmas-last-testimony">Emma’s last testimony</h2>

<p><a href="/a_careful_examination/last-testimony-of-sister-emma/">Emma’s last testimony</a> reads (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question. Could not father have dictated the Book of Mormon to you, Oliver Cowdery and the others who wrote for him, after having first written it, or having first read it out of some book?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Answer. Joseph Smith (and for the first time she used his name direct, having usually used the words, “your father” or “my husband”) <strong>could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter</strong>, let alone dictate a book like the Book of Mormon. And, though I was an active participant in the scenes that transpired, and was present during the translation of the plates, and had cognizance of things as they transpired, it is marvelous to me, “a marvel and a wonder,” as much so as to anyone else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, we have examples of <a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-emma-smith-6-june-1832/1">coherent letters Joseph Smith had written</a> shortly after the creation of the Book of Mormon.  In addition, in this same testimony <a href="/a_careful_examination/context-of-emma-smiths-bom-witness/">Emma seems to tell bald-face lies about Joseph Smith’s practice of polygamy</a>, so we can deduce that Emma was under pressure to emphasize a particular narrative that had little to do with actual fact, at least in some major ways.</p>

<h2 id="religious-and-educational-environment">Religious and educational environment</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Joseph Smith’s father had “been a merchant and a teacher.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1971/07/joseph-smiths-home-environment?lang=eng">Ensign 1971</a>).</li>
  <li>Hyrum attended <a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/705381677/Joseph-Smiths-doc-only-man-who-could-save-leg.html">Moore Academy at Dartmouth</a> (where he may have been exposed to <a href="/a_careful_examination/similarities-between-john-smiths-writings-and-bom/">the teachings of professor John Smith</a>)</li>
  <li>Joseph’s grandmother had been a schoolteacher and had taught Joseph’s mother. (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=A-cWAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA257#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Lydia%20Gates%20Mack%2C%20was%20a%20school-teacher%20and%20taught%20his%20mother%22&amp;f=false">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Joseph Smith had 3 years of “formal” education.  But compare that with other prolific authors of his era:
    <ul>
      <li>Abraham Lincoln: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_life_and_career_of_Abraham_Lincoln">about 1 year of “formal” education</a></li>
      <li>Walt Whitman: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman">6 years</a></li>
      <li>Mark Twain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain">5 years</a></li>
      <li>Herman Melville <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=amPSiPy0XJ4C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=herman+melville+years+of+schooling&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N5rQ1EEfpg&amp;sig=nOpniJzgoGCv5zFD6ftRrNPYlVk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijraPT3K_TAhVM7mMKHeoPARc4ChDoAQgnMAE#v=snippet&amp;q=%22six%20years%20of%20formal%20schooling%22&amp;f=false">6 years</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each of the above had less or only marginally more formal education than Joseph Smith and it goes without saying that those men were able to compose works of outstanding fiction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A recent analysis of Joseph’s education puts the number of years [at closer to seven] (<a href="https://www.academia.edu/31771595/Reassessing_Joseph_Smith_Jr._s_Formal_Education?auto=download">Reassessing Joseph Smith Jr.’s Formal Education in the Winter 2016 Dialogue</a>).</li>
  <li>Palmyra was <a href="/a_careful_examination/palmyra-was-rich-in-books/">rich in books</a>, generally.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="intellectual-powers">Intellectual powers</h2>

<p>John Taylor <a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-47?lang=eng">said of him</a> (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was ignorant of letters as the world has it, but <strong>the most profoundly learned and intelligent man that I ever met in my life</strong>, and I have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles, been on different continents and mingled among all classes and creeds of people, yet <strong>I have never met a man so intelligent as he was</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As an adult he attended some high school.  His teacher, William E. McLellin, <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705280695/Inside-the-lost-McLellin-notebook.html">described the experience</a> (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He attended my High school during the winter of 1834. He attended my school and learned science all winter. I learned the strength of his mind as the study and principles of science. Hence I think I knew him.  And I here say that <strong>he had one of strongest, well balanced, penetrating, and retentive minds of any with which I ever formed an acquaintance, among the thousands of my observation</strong>. Although when I took him into my school, he was without scientific knowledge or attainments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, although he wrote this letter 14 years after the final translation phase of the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith’s <a href="http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-james-arlington-bennet-13-november-1843/1#full-transcript">letter to James Arlington Bennet in 1843</a> demonstrates a command of rhetoric and repetition indicative of a powerful literary intellect.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Despite lacking extensive formal training, Joseph was clearly raised in a rich educational, religious, and scriptural environment, and he immersed himself in that environment for some time, at least.  Furthermore, those who associated with him intimately and in educational settings ascribed to him an extraordinarily powerful intellect.</p>

<p>Looking at the data as a whole, then, it seems reasonable to conclude that Joseph Smith was religiously, educationally, and intellectually <em>capable</em> of dictating a book like the Book of Mormon.</p>
