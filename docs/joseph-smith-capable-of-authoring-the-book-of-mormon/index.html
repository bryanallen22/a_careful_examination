    <p>It does not seem outside the realm of possibility given the environment in which he was raised and the intellect ascribed to him by some.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Joseph Smith’s father had “been a merchant and a teacher.” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1971/07/joseph-smiths-home-environment?lang=eng">source</a>).  Hyrum also worked in the offseason as a teacher (need to track down source).</li>
  <li>Joseph’s grandmother had been a schoolteacher and had taught Joseph’s mother. (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=A-cWAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA257#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Lydia%20Gates%20Mack%2C%20was%20a%20school-teacher%20and%20taught%20his%20mother%22&amp;f=false">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Joseph Smith had 3 years of “formal” education.  Abraham Lincoln only had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_life_and_career_of_Abraham_Lincoln">about 1 year of “formal” education</a>.  Walt Whitman (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman">6 years</a>), Mark Twain (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain">5 years</a>), and Herman Melville (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=amPSiPy0XJ4C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=herman+melville+years+of+schooling&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N5rQ1EEfpg&amp;sig=nOpniJzgoGCv5zFD6ftRrNPYlVk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijraPT3K_TAhVM7mMKHeoPARc4ChDoAQgnMAE#v=snippet&amp;q=%22six%20years%20of%20formal%20schooling%22&amp;f=false">6 years</a>) each had only marginally more formal education than Joseph Smith and it goes without saying that those men were able to compose works of outstanding fiction on meager formal schooling rations.</li>
  <li>A recent analysis of Joseph’s education (Reassessing Joseph Smith Jr.’s Formal Education in the Winter 2016 Dialogue) puts the number of years <a href="https://www.academia.edu/31771595/Reassessing_Joseph_Smith_Jr._s_Formal_Education?auto=download">at closer to seven</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>John Taylor <a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-47?lang=eng">said of him</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was ignorant of letters as the world has it, but the most profoundly learned and intelligent man that I ever met in my life, and I have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles, been on different continents and mingled among all classes and creeds of people, yet I have never met a man so intelligent as he was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As an adult he attended some high school.  His teacher, William E. McLellin, <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705280695/Inside-the-lost-McLellin-notebook.html">described the experience thusly</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He attended my High school during the winter of 1834. He attended my school and learned science all winter. I learned the strength of his mind as the study and principles of science. Hence I think I knew him.  And I here say that he had one of strongest, well balanced, penetrating, and retentive minds of any with which I ever formed an acquaintance, among the thousands of my observation. Although when I took him into my school, he was without scientific knowledge or attainments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, see the penmanship and note the general clarity and richness with which Joseph expresses himself in his <a href="http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-emma-smith-6-june-1832/1">letter to Emma 6 June 1832</a>.</p>
