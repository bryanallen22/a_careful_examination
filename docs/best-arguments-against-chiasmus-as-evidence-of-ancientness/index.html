    <p>Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon is often advanced as evidence of the ancient origin of the book.  However, the argument may not be as strong as when originally conceived:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Chiastic structure was described in a popular Bible commentary of the day.</strong></p>

    <p>Joseph Smith was very familiar with Clarke’s commentary on the bible—we know that he <a href="http://jur.byu.edu/?p=21296">borrowed liberally from the commentary in his JST</a>.  We also know that work on the JST began less than 2 years after the publication of the BoM.  Finally, I’m aware of at least one idea discussed in Clarke’s commentary that is found in the BoM (the idea that Jesus <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/7z6jg3/the_idea_that_jesus_sweated_drops_of_blood_out_of/">sweat drops of blood out of pores</a>), although it was also present elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Clarke’s commentary <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/81ysu1/chiasmus_proof_of_antiquity_or_red_herring/">clearly <em>describes</em> chiasmus</a>, even though it does not name it as such.  Hence, a plausible source for the concept of chiasmus was readily available in a book known to have been of interest to Joseph Smith.  While the known sequence of those events leaves open the possibility that the author of the BoM had not previously consulted Clarke’s commentary during the production of the BoM, the main point still stands—a clear description of chiasmus existed in one of the most popular bible commentaries of the day, and there is a close association between that commentary and Joseph Smith.</p>

    <p><em>I’m unaware of any rebuttals to this point</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Chiasmus may occur by chance, and may be demonstrated in many forms of communication—particularly if a researcher is willing to cherry-pick themes.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The argument may be made that the chiastic structure of Alma 36, held up as <a href="https://publications.mi.byu.edu/book/chiasmus-in-antiquity/">the most effective use of chiasm in the BoM</a>, <a href="https://dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V38N04_105.pdf">depends upon cherry-picking themes</a>.</li>
      <li>Extensive chiasmus <a href="http://www.davidgorton.com/Father/Articles/section76.html">may be identified in the Doctrine and Covenants</a>, again suggesting that the presence of chiasmus in the BoM is not necessarily evidence of ancientness.</li>
      <li>James Strang claimed to translate ancient documents which also <a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&amp;context=physics_facpub">appear to demonstrate chiastic structure</a>.</li>
      <li>It appears to be relatively easy to demonstrate chiastic structure in various forms of communication, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/65k95j/im_glad_that_fairmormon_exists_the_fairmormon/dh3lad0/">such as a string of reddit comments</a>.</li>
      <li>Chiasmus seems to occur in literature by chance.  Consider, for instance, <a href="https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V33N04_173.pdf">the chiastic structure of Green Eggs and Ham</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>The counter argument to the above is that the chiastic structures in the BoM exceed these other examples in length and/or complexity (and this is sometimes <a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&amp;context=physics_facpub">demonstrated statistically</a>), suggesting a deliberateness that is not necessarily present in these other examples.</em></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Am I missing any of the best arguments?  Is this synopsis fair and accurate?</p>

<p>Most of the above arguments h/t /u/djhoen and /u/ImTheMarmotKing</p>
