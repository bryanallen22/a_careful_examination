    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The core of Emma’s testimony as it relates to the Book of Mormon<sup id="fnref:platesexisted"><a href="#fn:platesexisted" class="footnote">1</a></sup> is summarized in condensed form below (emphasis added):</p>

<ul>
  <li>“[I] wrote day after day, often sitting at the table close by him [Joseph], he sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us … [with] <strong>neither manuscript nor book to read from</strong> … [which] he <strong>could not have concealed … from me</strong>.”</li>
  <li>“[Question] Where did father and Oliver Cowdery write? [Answer] … <strong>in the room where I was at work</strong>.”</li>
  <li>“My belief is that the Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity - I have not the slightest doubt of it. I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, your father would <strong>dictate to me hour after hour</strong>; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he could at once <strong>begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him</strong>. This was a usual thing for him to do. It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this; and, for one so ignorant and unlearned as he was, it was simply impossible.”</li>
  <li>“[Question] Could not father have dictated [it from a written manuscript]? [Answer] Joseph Smith … could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter, let alone dictate a book like the Book of Mormon. And, though I was an active participant in the scenes that transpired, and was present during the translation of the plates, and had cognizance of things as they transpired, it is marvelous to me … as much so as to anyone else.”</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, Emma claims:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To have been present and in close proximity during much/most of the translation process, acting both as scribe and as witness when Cowdery was scribe.</li>
  <li>Joseph could not have concealed a manuscript or book from which to read from.</li>
  <li>Joseph could not dictate a coherent or well-worded letter and so was especially incapable of dictating (i.e., orally composing) or writing the Book of Mormon.</li>
  <li>Joseph did not consult the dictated manuscript when he returned—he picked up where he left off during the translation process.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are good reasons, however, to discount this testimony.</p>

<h2 id="her-statements-on-polygamy-weaken-her-testimony-generally">Her statements on polygamy weaken her testimony generally</h2>

<p>As explained in greater detail <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/context-of-emma-smiths-bom-witness/">here</a>, Emma’s witness of the Book of Mormon follows directly after her testimony on polygamy.  She claims that Joseph never practiced polygamy, but it seems highly likely that he did.  Hence, if we accept that Joseph Smith was practicing polygamy (which is <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng">fully accepted by the modern LDS Church</a>) then we can conclude that Emma was either lying or she was naive about the actions of her husband—either because she was naive or because he was adept at hiding his actions or some combination.</p>

<h2 id="she-mis-characterizes-josephs-abilities">She mis-characterizes Joseph’s abilities</h2>

<p>Emma claims that Joseph “could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter; let alone dictat[e] a book like the Book of Mormon.”</p>

<p>However, the historical record demonstrates that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Joseph was writing <a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-emma-smith-6-june-1832/1">very coherent letters</a> shortly after the publication of the Book of Mormon.</li>
  <li>Especially later in his life, Joseph demonstrated remarkable compositional ability in <a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-james-arlington-bennet-13-november-1843/1#full-transcript">other letters</a>.</li>
  <li>As a youth, Joseph was, according to his own account, <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/joseph-smith-capable-of-authoring-the-book-of-mormon/#own-statements">steeped in the religious conversations of his day</a>.</li>
  <li>Within just a few years since the translation of the Book of Mormon Joseph was consulting Clarke’s commentary, a sophisticated Bible commentary, and incorporating it in <a href="http://jur.byu.edu/?p=21296">“hundreds” of instances into his Joseph Smith Translation of the bible</a>.</li>
  <li>Joseph <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/joseph-smith-capable-of-authoring-the-book-of-mormon/#intellectual-powers">had an extraordinary intellect</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="emma-may-not-have-been-present-when-sources-were-consulted">Emma may not have been present when sources were consulted</h2>

<p>Emma only served as scribe for part of the the lost 116 pages, and we have no way to know the coherence of that portion since those pages are not extant.  She mentions observing Oliver and Joseph during dictation, but:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We cannot imagine that Emma sat and observed the entire process (i.e., was she always home?  Was she always in the same room?)</li>
  <li>We know that Emma was separated from Joseph and Oliver <a href="https://scottwoodward.org/bookofmormon_translationprocess_timeline.html">for at least brief periods of time</a> during the translation period.</li>
  <li>The last <em>month</em> of translation occured in the upstairs room of Peter Whitmer’s home.  Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosiah_priority">the Mosiah Priority</a>, this month likely included the dictation of 1st and 2nd Nephi, both of which contain large blocks of Isaiah that may have been copied directly from the 1769 KJV Bible.<sup id="fnref:deuteroisaiah"><a href="#fn:deuteroisaiah" class="footnote">2</a></sup>  Witness statements place Emma downstairs during the day and the translators upstairs.<sup id="fnref:downstairsupstairs"><a href="#fn:downstairsupstairs" class="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
</ol>

    <li id="fn:platesexisted">
      <p>Emma also emphasized that the plates physically existed: “The plates often lay on the table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen tablecloth, which I had given him to fold them in. I once felt of the plates, as they thus lay on the table, tracing their outline and shape. They seemed to be pliable like thick paper, and would rustle with a metallic sound when the edges were moved by the thumb …”  Since the plates were not directly involved in the creation of the Book of Mormon and both Latter-day Saint scholars (<a href="https://www.deseret.com/2010/10/29/20367586/mormon-scholar-explains-the-historical-difficulty-created-by-the-golden-plates">for example</a>) and non-LDS scholars (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmX-H1GBivk">for example</a>) affirm their existence on some level, I will not address the topic here. <a href="#fnref:platesexisted" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:deuteroisaiah">
      <p>To deal with deutero-Isaiah in the Book of Mormon, <a href="https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Anachronisms/Biblical/Deutero-Isaiah">FairMormon hypothesizes</a> that Joseph consulted the KJV Bible directly instead of the ancient manuscript (emphasis added): “As Joseph was translating the text of the Book of Mormon, he would find himself translating something that he recognized as being roughly similar to texts from the Bible. This would occur most prominently when Nephi quotes from Isaiah.  <strong>Instead of translating Nephi’s quotations of Isaiah, Joseph, deferred to the KJV translation of those chapters.</strong> This may have been done to save time and to respect the quality of the KJV Bible. The chapters of Isaiah that we find in the Book of Mormon were taken largely by Joseph Smith from the KJV Bible, instead of being translated from Nephi’s version of that text. In other words, why reinvent the wheel when the work has already been done?” <a href="#fnref:deuteroisaiah" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:downstairsupstairs">
      <p>In <a href="https://archive.bookofmormoncentral.org/content/miraculous-translation-book-mormon">an interview</a>, David Whitmer describes how (emphasis added): “[Joseph] went <strong>downstairs</strong>, out into the orchard and made supplication to the Lord; was gone about an hour—came back to the house, and asked Emma’s forgiveness and then came <strong>upstairs where we were and the translation went on all right</strong>” <a href="#fnref:downstairsupstairs" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
