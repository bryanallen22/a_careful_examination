    <p>[very rough draft]</p>

<p>The core of Emma’s testimony as it relates to the Book of Mormon<sup id="fnref:platesexisted"><a href="#fn:platesexisted" class="footnote">1</a></sup> is summarized in condensed form below (emphasis added):</p>

<ul>
  <li>“[I] wrote day after day, often sitting at the table close by him [Joseph], he sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us … [with] <strong>neither manuscript nor book to read from</strong> … [which] he <strong>could not have concealed … from me</strong>.”</li>
  <li>“[Question] Where did father and Oliver Cowdery write? [Answer] … <strong>in the room where I was at work</strong>.”</li>
  <li>“My belief is that the Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity - I have not the slightest doubt of it. I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, your father would <strong>dictate to me hour after hour</strong>; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he could at once <strong>begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him</strong>. This was a usual thing for him to do. It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this; and, for one so ignorant and unlearned as he was, it was simply impossible.”</li>
  <li>“[Question] Could not father have dictated [it from a written manuscript]? [Answer] Joseph Smith … could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter, let alone dictate a book like the Book of Mormon. And, though I was an active participant in the scenes that transpired, and was present during the translation of the plates, and had cognizance of things as they transpired, it is marvelous to me … as much so as to anyone else.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Emma claims:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To have been present and in close proximity during much/most of the translation process, acting both as scribe and as witness when Cowdery was scribe.</li>
  <li>Joseph could not have concealed a manuscript or book from which to read from.</li>
  <li>Joseph could not dictate a coherent or well-worded letter and so was especially incapable of dictating (i.e., orally composing) or writing the Book of Mormon.</li>
  <li>Joseph did not consult the dictated manuscript when he returned—he picked up where he left off during the translation process.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="emma-sidesteps-the-existing-manuscript-question">Emma sidesteps the existing manuscript question</h2>

<h2 id="emma-was-probably-lying-about-other-aspects-of-her-testimony">Emma was probably lying about other aspects of her testimony</h2>

<h3 id="joseph-practiced-polygamy">Joseph practiced polygamy</h3>

<p>In that very same interview, her “last testimony”, Emma emphatically <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/context-of-emma-smiths-bom-witness/">denies that Joseph Smith practiced polygamy</a>, but the data strongly suggest that she did, in fact, know about his polygamy.[^emma_lied_about_polygamy]  Emma may have felt pressure to sustain the narrative that was supporting her son and her livelihood, to some extent.  In any event, if she was willing to lie about polygamy, then that is some reason to be skeptical of other statements delivered in the same context.</p>

<p>Another option to consider is that perhaps Emma was being fooled by Joseph during the translation process.  The historical record indicates that at least on some matters Joseph had no problem keeping things from Emma.  <a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng">The Nauvoo polygamy essay</a> states: “But Emma likely did not know about all of Joseph’s sealings”.  Furthermore, if the Partridge sisters’ testimony can be believed, Joseph had the Partridge sisters sealed to him a second time in order to hide the first sealings (which happened behind Emma’s back) from Emma’s knowledge, thus leading her to believe that the second sealing was the first (see Marquardt’s <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oscY6">Emily on the Witness Stand</a>).  Either Joseph completely hid the sealings from Emma, or if the Partridge sisters’ testimony is correct, then Joseph was not above performing an elaborate ritual for the purposes of deliberately deceiving his wife.  Hence, if Joseph was not being up-front with Emma about his sealings/marriages, it seems reasonable to be generally suspicious of her level of knowledge with the creation of the Book of Mormon, also.</p>

<h2 id="may-have-downplayed-other-aspects">May have downplayed other aspects</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joseph Smith’s wife, Emma, the person who knew him better than any other, confirmed this conclusion: “Joseph Smith [as a young man] could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter; let alone dictat[e] a book like the Book of Mormon.”[32]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As discussed in detail above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We have good reasons to doubt Emma’s testimony or perhaps to conclude that she had been fooled by Joseph.</li>
  <li>Joseph was steeped in the religious conversations of his day and had an extraordinary intellect.</li>
  <li>Joseph dictated a large amount of other scripture, sometimes <a href="http://jur.byu.edu/?p=21296">incorporating other sources</a>.</li>
  <li>It is possible (though not necessary to a modern origin theory) that others—equally or more acquainted with the religious arguments of the day—collaborated in the creation of the book.</li>
</ul>

<p>LOTS Of interesting ideas <a href="http://www.mormonthink.com/josephweb.htm">here</a>,
many of which align with avenues I’ve been thinking about….</p>

<p>As discussed previously, Emma’s emphatic testimony is coupled with dishonesty about polygamy, so we have reason to doubt her reliability as a witness.  And, as part of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, her livelihood depended on others’ continued belief in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon—she may have been motivated to stretch the truth.  Finally, we must balance her testimony with the testimony of others suggesting that Joseph had a powerful mind and the data suggesting he was not ignorant or unlearned.  And, even if she were accurate, it remains possible that the manuscript was produced in collaboration with others.</p>

<p>Emma didn’t receive most of the book, and she received none of what is now
considered the Book of Mormon.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:platesexisted">
      <p>Emma also emphasized that the plates physically existed: “The plates often lay on the table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen tablecloth, which I had given him to fold them in. I once felt of the plates, as they thus lay on the table, tracing their outline and shape. They seemed to be pliable like thick paper, and would rustle with a metallic sound when the edges were moved by the thumb …”  Since the plates were not directly involved in the creation of the Book of Mormon and both Latter-day Saint scholars (<a href="https://www.deseret.com/2010/10/29/20367586/mormon-scholar-explains-the-historical-difficulty-created-by-the-golden-plates">for example</a>) and non-LDS scholars (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmX-H1GBivk">for example</a>) affirm their existence on some level, I will not address the topic here. <a href="#fnref:platesexisted" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
