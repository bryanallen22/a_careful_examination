documents/science/april-1910-PQT-statement-misconstrued.md:67:The basic counterargument, which I articulated in some part a few years ago [in a conversation with Shapiro](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/aa94b82ae8d0292dec0cf15c7451b07f9ff32dcd/documents/science/response_to_how_to_mix_LDS_theology_and_human_evolution.pdf) and which Ugo Perego expressed to me in private communication, is that it seems unreasonable that Joseph F. Smith would have been unaware of the "Origin of Man" response in the PQT.  There are a few, related arguments:
documents/same_sex_marriage/the_three_modules_of_marriage_and_related_thoughts.md:51:It seems to me that if a group or individual is interested in Old Testament (or even New Testament) prohibitions, then they need some coherent reason for selecting some and not others.  Latter-day Saints argue "modern day revelation" when dealing with same-sex marriage, but I am not aware of any modern day revelation having been received on that topic, ever. (note that all available evidence suggests [the family proclamation should not be viewed as revelation](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/7c67d2029f5b38669069b9af5d4f1305df2a2c51/documents/family-proclamation/family_proclamation_not_scripture_a_legal_document.pdf))
documents/book_of_abraham/olishem/olishem.md:67:A map located in Allegheny College (in Pennsylvania), a few hundred miles from where Joseph Smith lived during the Book of Mormon translation, also [contains the words 'Barrai-al Sham'](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/5aa4bfdd683471d1619294ac5f38a5793b238f75/documents/book_of_abraham/olishem/barrai-alSham.png) right where the plains of Olishem would be located.  Next to the name is written: "In this Desert are found the Ruins of several ancient Cities".  Not far below is written the text "Beled Shemer".  Someone seeing this map could easily notice the last part of Barrai-al Sham ("al Sham") and convolute it with the "Shem" from Shemer right below to form "Olishem".
documents/book_of_abraham/olishem/olishem.md:72:Note that the same map [also contains "Nehem"](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/5aa4bfdd683471d1619294ac5f38a5793b238f75/documents/book_of_abraham/olishem/barrai-alSham_and_Nehem.png) in its approximate location.
documents/book_of_abraham/olishem/olishem.md:74:Another old map of the Arabian Peninsula, "Accuratissima et Maxima Totius Turcici Imperii Tabula", [has the word "Olim"](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/94faa49f147c2ae8137c58e111ee400bdac490e2/documents/book_of_abraham/olishem/Accuratissima_et_Maxima_Totius_Turcici_Imperii_Tabula.png) right in the middle of the top part of the peninsula roughly where we'd expect the plains of Olishem to be located.  Adjacent to the word "Olim" is written "Meschel Ocem" which could have easily provided the 'sh' sound for "Olishem".
documents/conclusion.md:37:I few disclaimers are in order.  This model is not to suggest that those who are yet incapable of genuinely examining LDS truth-claims are, on the whole, developmentally inferior to those who have investigated---these individuals may be psychologically independent or further developed in many _other_ facets of life than a given truth-claim investigator.  It's also safe to say that a former member may experience similar child-like vulnerability in defense of their cherished beliefs (so this analysis is not meant to elevate the former member above the current member even though it is focused on the LDS belief system).  In fact, I think it is possible for a believing member to have matured ideologically well beyond a given former member (so, perhaps corresponding to [a high level in Fowler's stages of faith](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/master/conclusion.md)).  In addition, these kinds of propensities may be based in large part on genetic-based tendencies or environmental contingencies outside the control of the individual, so reserving judgement is in order.  It's also worth noting that a believing member unable or unwilling to explore the truth-claim data may be able to achieve more within the LDS scaffold than their truth-claim investigating counterparts outside the LDS scaffold since the believer must devote fewer mental and emotional resources to the daunting exploration of the existential than the investigator.
documents/my_journey/brief_sketch_of_my_journey.md:27:After carefully examining alternative models for the Church's foundational truth claims, I decided that alternative models fit the data *much* better than the LDS narratives ([either official or apologetic](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/bae1310b06ddc13ac1714dd6a43fda3b4661af09/documents/the_dominant_narrative_cannot_be_sustained/the_dominant_narrative.pdf)).  In my opinion, the fit is remarkable even using only the data that is generally accepted / acknowledged by LDS apologists.[^differentinterpretations]
documents/my_journey/brief_sketch_of_my_journey.md:41:This time of viewing life from outside the Gospel/Church perspective---which is the only perspective I've ever really known---has been one of the most enlightening phases of my life (similar to the major enlightenment I experienced on my mission).  Many things that never quite made sense suddenly have an explanation to my mind, and that's extremely satisfying.[^makingsense]  And, as far as my own sense of moral obligation goes, I feel confident that [morality transcends religious belief](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/master/documents/morality_transcends_religious_belief/morality_transcends_religious_belief.pdf) and is still central to living a good life.

To a large extent, our dedication to the Church ramped up as a response to my close relative leaving.

Now that I've left, family members have criticized me for taking the Gospel *too seriously*, but I do not think my actions are inconsistent with the messages taught in lesson manuals, church literature, and General Conference---if anything I felt like I was perpetually falling short so I should humbly continue to improve and become *more* dedicated.
documents/what_I_have_shared_with_my_children/what_I_have_shared_with_my_children_about_lds_truth_claims.md:23:Finally, it should be noted that the tenor of my conversations are generally positive, and I am hope and goodness affirming (see [an outline of my beliefs](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/820370d7a9d95cdeec1f478c20535c0a3ef48615/documents/my_beliefs/summary_of_my_beliefs.pdf)).  In addition, there are compelling arguments suggesting that [morality transcends religious belief](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/master/documents/morality_transcends_religious_belief/morality_transcends_religious_belief.pdf), so I speak freely about the merit and satisfaction of living a moral life.

documents/polygamy/denials/brotherton-irony.md:74:[^hales]: Hales indicated that at least the general contours of the affidavit were believable since it was consistent with the proposition pattern that would emerge.  In another communication he indicated that we don't know how much of Brotherton's affidavit is accurate (which seems fair to say) but [he did not respond for clarification](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/12e1a31745c0bc3f2d45f0b53ca7d5e5f813d9fb/communications/discussion-on-believing-women.md) on _how_ Martha's affidavit may have been inaccurate.  In general, Martha's affidavit exhibits a level of restraint and lack of embellishment that is not consistent with much of the rest of Bennett's work, so I also think we have little reason to doubt the basic outline of the story.  Regardless, the main point of her affidavit was that she was propositioned to take part in a polygamous marriage, and there is little reason to doubt that this actually occurred.

In it Martha describes a polygamous marriage proposal to her from Brigham Young and endorsed by Joseph Smith.  It explicitly involved Martha becoming a second wife to Brigham Young.  Also, please note that the wives of Joseph Smith referred to their unions [in precisely the same manner](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/2cb7ada5e01920f16b4b8e9d397cb36a92c983d3/documents/polygamy/denials/how_did_the_wives_of_JS_speak_about_it.pdf) as Brotherton.

Martha's affidavit primarily makes the claim that Joseph and Brigham attempted to persuade her that polygamy was approved of God and to become Brigham's wife.

documents/polygamy/plural_marriage_emphasized_before_civil_sealings.md:33:The data clearly show that the initial emphasis of the sealing ceremony was on enacting plural sealings---sealings for civilly  married couples appears to have been of much less concern.  This emphasis also seems to be confirmed in other instances, such as JS's sealing to Lucy Walker but [lack of a sealing for William Holmes Walker](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/c442ec967fc02943365dd08a6f64b0d5bbb92060/documents/polygamy/william-holmes-walker.md).
documents/polygamy/why_no_children.md:49:A variety of possibilities exist to help to potentially account for Joseph Smith not impregnating his plural wives.  Regardless, [significant evidence exists that Joseph did have sex with many of his wives](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/27159d5d2cf14aa7da733e78e201951f8ca6865d/documents/polygamy/evidence_of_sex.md).  And, other early practices of polygamy were impregnating their wives (e.g., Brigham Young), so it seems odd to claim that Joseph's polygamy was somehow radically different (i.e., asexual).

documents/book_of_mormon/probability-trito-isaiah-not-in-book-of-mormon.md:30:But we may even be too generous here.  The vast majority of all other Isaiah citations come from just seven other consecutive chapters, Isaiah 48--54.  Again, the distribution here can't be called "random" in the least---these are _blocks_ of chapters which seem to have been selected.  What happens if we go back and ask how likely it is that two blocks of chapters, one 13 chapters long and one 7 chapters long, can be randomly selected from Isaiah without selecting a single trito-Isaiah chapter?  I wrote up [a script](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/e5a43715b09837fcabdc6664f3f0d00b0fbacaf1/scripts/trito-isaiah.rb) to enumerate every possibility (also throwing out overlaps and such) and calculated the probabilities.  Turns out the probabibility that _both_ chunks could randomly be selected from non trito chapters is 0.56, or 56%.  So, thinking about the selection as two random chunks now pushes the probability _in favor of Smith getting lucky_---he was more likely to grab continuous chunks that never touch trito-Isaiah than do touch it.
documents/book_of_mormon/probability-trito-isaiah-not-in-book-of-mormon.md:37:Finally, if we assume that the first 13 chapters can be explained by selecting, essentially, the first chapters from the book of Isaiah, and we ask what is the probability that another chunk of 7 chapters would include a single trito-Isaiah chapter, the odds are that Joseph _would not_ have selected an additional seven chapter chunk with a single chapter of trito-Isaiah in it (74% probability that he would not have selected a seven chapter chunk that included a single trito-Isaiah chapter).  Again, I calculated the probability by enumerating every possibility (since I already had [the basic script](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/e5a43715b09837fcabdc6664f3f0d00b0fbacaf1/scripts/trito-isaiah.rb)).
documents/book_of_mormon/probability-trito-isaiah-not-in-book-of-mormon.md:48:The above analysis is important for demonstrating that Smith could have randomly avoided the trito-Isaiah chapters with only a minor amount of luck.  Still, it misses the deeper point about the Isaiah found in the Book of Mormon: We don't expect to see deutero-Isaiah in the form we see it in, and, according to Grant Hardy, we don't even expect to see Isaiah 2--14 in the form we find it.

The growth mindset, on the other hand, argues that *doing* the right thing (typically sidestepping totalistic concerns) is more important than preserving the good name of the institution, following leaders, or even belief in the system itself---it would be better for the institution to fail or for a person to lose their belief / testimony in the Church than to act wrongly or fail to live growth principles.  For a believing member, these values *can* be reconciled, at least in theory.[^reconciliation]  In practice, tension is often experienced by members on the *toughest* issues---issues dealing with real or perceived existential threats to testimony or the institution itself.
