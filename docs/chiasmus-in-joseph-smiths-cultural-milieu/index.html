<blockquote>
  <p>In his book, Early Mormonism and the Magic World View, D. Michael Quinn obliterates Welch’s claims in a footnote. Quinn points out that Robert Lowth’s study of chiasmus in the Bible from 1787 was available in an American edition by 1815, well before the 1830 publication of the Book of Mormon. Welch himself admits this in his 1970 master’s thesis, although he hasn’t acknowledged it since.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chiasmus received much more recognition with the first American edition of Thomas Hartwell Horne’s Introduction To the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in 1825. Not only was Horne’s book advertised in Palmyra’s newspaper (which Joseph Smith was known to have read), but the 1818 London edition of the book was for sale by 1820 in the Canandaigua Bookstore (which also had a lending library) only nine miles from Smith’s home.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Far from being nearly impossible, Joseph Smith being aware of chiasmus is actually rather likely. He could have found out about it by going to a nearby library or bookstore, by noticing the advertisement in the newspaper he always read, or by having a conversation with someone who’d heard about it. Sorry John, but chiasmus does not prove the Book of Mormon is true.</p>

<hr />

<p>In D. Michael Quinn’s <em>Early Mormonism and the Magic World View</em>, p. 192, he states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Similar to John W. Welch’s claims about pre-1830 America’s alleged ignorance of a form of biblical parallelism (<em>chiasmus</em>), Nibley understated the access of Palmyra’s residents in the mid-1820s to information about the pseudepigraphic Enoch.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Follow fn108 to the appendix on pp 499-504. Quinn basically here submits an essay expounding John Welch’s discovery of chiasmus in the BoM and subsequent dishonesty about Joseph’s access to scholastic materials available at the time. From p. 500:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Advertised for sale in Joseph Smith’s neighborhood, Horne’s 1825 <em>Introduction To the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures</em> emphasized …: ‘The grand, and indeed, sole characteristic of Hebrew Poetry, is what Bishop Lowthe entitles <em>Parallelism</em>, that is, a certain quality, resemblance, or relationship, between the members of each period; so that in two lines, or members of the same period, things shall answer to things, and words to words, as if fitted to each other by a kind of rule or measure. This is the general strain of the Hebrew poetry; instances of which occur in almost every part of the Old Testament …’ … Horne further explained … that these ‘<em>Parallel constructions and figures</em>’ referred to ‘those passages in which the same sentence is expressed not precisely in the same words, but in <em>similar</em> words’ … Horne’s 1825 American edition said that such parallelism would be found in any ancient text written by Hebrews. … [p. 501: In the same edition,] Horne also gave … several diagrams of ‘<em>Parallel Lines Introverted</em> … [Horne quotes a pair of multi-line chiasmus from Isaiah and Psalms that follow the typical ABCDCBA structure].”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is chiasmus a reputable form of ancient Hebrew poetry? Yes. Was it also a common Old English poetic mechanism? Yes. Bill Shakespeare made abundant use of it. In my opinion, some Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon are outstanding achievements (e.g. Alma 36 in its entirety). Other purported examples can be a bit of a stretch. But Joseph Smith (and any accomplices) had everything he needed to compose such a book. To see the entire Book of Mormon reformatted to fit Hebrew poetic styles, I recommend Perry’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poetic-Parallelisms-Book-Mormon-Reformatted/dp/B002497BT8"><em>Poetic Parallelisms in the Book of Mormon</em></a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, several unique changes made to Isaiah in the Book of Mormon actually ruin or obscure other types of Hebrew poetry native to the Masoretic texts. I recommend picking up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Apocrypha-Essays-Mormon-Mormonism/dp/1560851511"><em>American Apocrypha</em></a> and reading David P. Wright’s essay, “Isaiah in the Book of Mormon: Or Joseph Smith in Isaiah” - it is a bit technical, but an excellent treatment of the subject. Regardless of one’s position on its authorship, the Book of Mormon as dictation literature is actually very, very impressive.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Book of Mormon contains a large number of inverted parallelisms, today referred to as “chiasmus”, reminiscent of those found in the Old and New Testament.  At the time, and for decades following their discovery in the Book of Mormon, it was thought that the idea of chiasmus in scripture would likely have been inaccessible to Joseph Smith<sup id="fnref:assumes_no_intuition"><a href="#fn:assumes_no_intuition" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.  Because of this, their presence in the Book of Mormon is often touted as <a href="https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/chiasmus-book-mormon">evidence of an ancient origin of the book</a>.</p>

<p>However, the concept of “chiasmus”—along with its importance to ancient Hebrew scripture like the Old Testament—has been somewhat recently discovered (<a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1503&amp;context=msr">Welch 2003</a>) in the proper time and place to have influenced someone like Joseph Smith in their production of the Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>Although its significance is downplayed in the 2003</p>

    <li id="fn:assumes_no_intuition">
      <p>It is <em>possible</em> for a person intimately familiar with the Bible to intuit that kind of poetic structure through textual familiarity with an English translation alone.  However, arguments that chiasmus in the Book of Mormon is evidence of its ancientness assume that a modern translator would not have intuited this structure without previous exposure to the idea. <a href="#fnref:assumes_no_intuition" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
