  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Brian Hauglid is a leading LDS Scholar on the history of the Book of Abraham and one of two editors responsible for <a href="https://www.bookofmormoncentral.org/blog/new-joseph-smith-papers-volume-published">The Joseph Smith Papers, Revelations and Translations, Vol. 4: Book of Abraham and Related Manuscripts</a>.  The Book of Abraham gospel topics essay references Hauglid when it <a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham?lang=eng">describes the missing papryi theory</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is likely futile to assess Joseph’s ability to translate papyri when we now have only a fraction of the papyri he had in his possession. Eyewitnesses spoke of “a long roll” or multiple “rolls” of papyrus. [32] Since only fragments survive, it is likely that much of the papyri accessible to Joseph when he translated the book of Abraham is not among these fragments. The loss of a significant portion of the papyri means the relationship of the papyri to the published text cannot be settled conclusively by reference to the papyri.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footnote 32 points to a source written by Hauglid:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[32] Hauglid, Textual History of the Book of Abraham, 213–14, 222.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="recent-reversal">Recent reversal</h3>

<p>Brian recently said (at <a href="https://youtu.be/y3-SKjlNOCQ?t=3166">52:46</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s also an argument that the Book of Abraham was on papyri that we no longer have–it’s called the missing paypri theory–at least from my perspective, anyway, I’ve found evidence that argues against that [the missing paypri theory] that they were working off of the papyri that we actually have in the Church today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dan Vogel and many other non-LDS scholars have been making this argument for a long time (although it’s not clear if they are basing their conclusion on the same data since Hauglid has not yet discussed his data or rationale, to my knowledge).  Vogel’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtJT_xjIgdM">latest video series</a> lays out the evidence very clearly, and he makes a very persuasive case.</p>

<p>Dan Vogel also recently noted<sup id="fnref:2000shift"><a href="#fn:2000shift" class="footnote">1</a></sup> (in the info notes on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I47ibkJ4QrE">part 6 of his Truth of the Book of Abraham series</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a recent Facebook response, Brian Hauglid, one of the BYU “apologists” featured in my Book of Abraham videos, clarified his current position and now wishes to disassociate himself from the views of John Gee and Kerry Muhlestein. As an endorsement of these videos and a service to Hauglid, I post a portion of his statement here:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For the record, I no longer hold the views that have been quoted from my 2010 book in these videos. … In fact, I’m no longer interested or involved in apologetics in any way. I wholeheartedly agree with Dan’s excellent assessment of the Abraham/Egyptian documents in these videos. … One can find that I’ve changed my mind in my recent and forthcoming publications. The most recent JSP Revelations and Translation vol. 4, The Book of Abraham and Related Manuscripts (now on the shelves) is much more open to Dan’s thinking on the origin of the Book of Abraham.” (Brian Hauglid, Facebook, 8 Nov. 2018)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A visual demonstrating (at a superficial level) the documentary evidence that the Book of Abraham characters associated with the translation were pulled from the papyri now in the Church’s possession may be found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/9yt977/the_book_of_abraham_11218_graphic/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong>: Reddit user <code class="highlighter-rouge">fuzzy_thoughts</code> pointed out Hauglid in Vogel’s video info section and the connection to Hauglid in the gospel topics essay.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:2000shift">
      <p>Reddit user admiraldjibouti noted that Hauglid has held a nuanced view of the Book of Abraham for perhaps a very long time:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>I took a class at BYU on the Pearl of Great Price from Hauglid back in 2000 or 2001 and he was pretty much saying the papyri was the Book of the Dead and we needed a more nuanced view of the Book of Abraham already.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>I’m not certain how to reconcile this with what seems like his more recent shift.  Perhaps Hauglid is merely more convinced against the missing papyri theory. <a href="#fnref:2000shift" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
