    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In support of the idea that the doctrines contained in the Book of Mormon must have been from a divine source because they were not taught in Joseph Smith’s contemporary Christianity, <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/tad-r-callister_book-mormon-man-made-god-given/">Tad Callister argued</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… contrary to contemporary beliefs, the Book of Mormon refers to a premortal existence in Alma 13 (see Alma 13:1–11)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An analysis of the pre-1830’s literature convincingly demonstrates that many Christians were teaching the idea of a premortal existence.</p>

<h3 id="the-evidence">The Evidence</h3>

<p>Terryl Givens recently wrote a book on the topic of the premortal existence in various thought across time (When Souls Had Wings).  He <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705380211/Terryl-Givens-Pre-mortal-existence-not-a-new-concept.html?pg=all">recently commented</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The LDS faith is the only significant Christian denomination teaching this doctrine today.  But it turns out, <strong>literally dozens—perhaps hundreds—of poets, mystics, philosophers, theologians and pastors have taught this same principle across the centuries</strong>. (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, importantly, Givens indicated that Joseph Smith was likely exposed to these ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One should not assume that because I am LDS, I must be writing with the intention of mustering arguments on behalf of an LDS theology. If that were indeed the case, I would have failed entirely. For in the entire history of the idea of a premortal soul, virtually no version matches Joseph Smith’s conception or shows evidence of having influenced his own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Elsewhere, Givens notes that the brand of pre-mortal existence Joseph Smith
taught was idosyncratic.  Still, the Book of Mormon does not fully represent
the most fully idiosyncratic version.</p>

<h3 id="new-testament-allusions">New Testament allusions</h3>

<p>The author of Alma 13 <a href="https://www.bookofmormonorigins.com/content/alma/chapter_13.html">repeatedly alludes to teachings and phrases from the New Testament</a> rather than the Old Testament.  This aligns more closely with a modern author rather than an author writing before the creation of the New Testament.</p>
