<blockquote>
  <p>And yet in Jane Manning’s patriarchal blessing, Hyrum Smith indicates that all is not lost. Like the potential redemption of the Native American descendants of the Lamanites, whose cursed dark skin could be made “white and delightsome” through faith and piety, Hyrum Smith comforts Jane Manning, “for he that changeth times and seasons and placed a mark upon your forehead, can take it off and stamp upon you his own linage.”[116] In Nauvoo, the church’s prophet offered Jane Manning the chance to be adopted into his family. And the church’s patriarch told Manning that she could part ways with her inherited identity as a daughter of Canaan, Ham, and Cain. She, too, could join the blessed lineage of Heavenly Father’s chosen people.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet such a change was conditional on Jane Manning’s decision to properly exercise her agency. In the conclusion of the blessing, Hyrum Smith establishes a pathway toward this alternative lineage by offering Manning avery tailored, racially specific covenantal contract: “Behold I say unto you jane if thou doest well thou shalt be accepted; if thou doest not well Sin lieth at the Door.” The import of Hyrum’s choice of words here cannot be overstated. Hyrum cites word for word Moses 5:23, which is his brother Joseph’s translation and slight alteration of Genesis 4:7.[117] In the Bible and in the book of Moses, this passage is part of the conversation between God and Cain that comes directly before Cain rises up against his brother and slays him.”</p>

  <p>Footnote 116. See Daniel 2;21, “And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding”; Smith, A Patriarchal Blessing of Jane Manning, CHL.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Footnote 117. Genesis 4:7 reads: “If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou does not well, sin lieth at the door.” In Moses 5:23, Joseph changes the rhetorical question found in the KJV of Genesis to a definitive period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For reference, Moses 5:22–23:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>22 And the Lord said unto Cain: Why art thou wroth? Why is thy countenance fallen?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>23 <strong>If thou doest well, thou shalt be accepted. And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door</strong>, and Satan desireth to have thee; and except thou shalt hearken unto my commandments, I will deliver thee up, and it shall be unto thee according to his desire. And thou shalt rule over him;</p>
