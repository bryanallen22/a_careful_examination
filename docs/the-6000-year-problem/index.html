    <p>Summary: The Church currently teaches that Adam and Eve ushered in the temporal existence of the earth approximately 6000 years ago.  At least on its face, this idea is incompatible with the archaeological record.</p>

<hr />

<p>Joseph Smith claimed to receive direct revelation from God on various topics, and this Q&amp;A session is recorded as Doctrine and Covenants 77.  Here are <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/77.6-7">verses 6–7</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q. What are we to understand by the book which John saw, which was sealed on the back with seven seals?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A. We are to understand that it contains the revealed will, mysteries, and the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q. What are we to understand by the seven seals with which it was sealed?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A. We are to understand that the first seal contains the things of the first thousand years, and the second also of the second thousand years, and so on until the seventh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to this direct revelation, Adam and Eve existed sometime around 4,000 BCE and this was approximately when the earth began its temporal existence.  This date is difficult to reconcile with what is known about, for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Indigenous_Australians#Origins">Australian aboriginal artifacts</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_agriculture">the invention of agriculture</a>, or the evidence suggesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho#History_and_archaeology">continuous inhabitation of the city of Jericho since 9,000 BCE</a>.</p>

<p>Note: The idea that the earth began its temporal existence 6,000 years ago should not be confused with the length of creation (i.e., the 6 “days” of creation are different than the 7 seals referred to by Joseph Smith in D&amp;C 77 <a href="http://ndbf.net/002m/Overview.jpg">as diagrammed here</a>).  The Church freely admits the earth could have been created over a long period of time, suggesting that the “the Hebrew word for day … can also be used in the sense of an indeterminate length of time” (<a href="http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Earth">Encyclopedia of Mormonism: Earth</a>).</p>

<h3 id="current-teachings">Current Teachings</h3>

<p>The LDS Church <em>currently</em> teaches the idea that the earth began its temporal existence (beginning with the Fall) roughly 6,000 years ago.  Note that every manual linked below is its <em>current</em> version (as of December 2016).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“‘The book which John saw’ represented the real history of the world—what the eye of God has seen, what the recording angel has written; and the seven thousand years, corresponding to the seven seals of the Apocalyptic volume, are as seven great days during which Mother Earth will fulfill her mortal mission, laboring six days and resting upon the seventh, her period of sanctification. These seven days do not include the period of our planet’s creation and preparation as a dwelling place for man. They are limited to Earth’s ‘temporal existence,’ that is, to Time, considered as distinct from Eternity.” (Whitney, Saturday Night Thoughts, p. 11.)</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>When the first seal is opened in the beginning verses of Revelation 6, there is shown to John an important occurrence from the first thousand years after the Fall. The Bible dictionary of the LDS edition of the King James Bible places the Fall near 4000 B.C. (See Bible Dictionary, p. 635.) When the second seal is opened in the subsequent verses, John is shown something about the second thousand years. And so on through the first four seals. The fifth seal information presented to John represents both a time period and some events of which John knew a great deal.</p>
