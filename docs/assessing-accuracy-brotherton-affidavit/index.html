    <p>[<strong>VERY ROUGH DRAFT</strong>]</p>

<p>Bennett is a complicated source.  On some level, it is clear that he had access to inside information that has been verified by scholars over time (for instance, he was able to indicate by initials many of Joseph’s early polygamous wives).  At the same time, <a href="http://mormonpolygamydocuments.org/john-c-bennett-joseph-smiths-polygamy-addressing-question-reliability/">he was a serial adulterer</a>, and <a href="https://archive.org/stream/jmormhist.42.3.0094#page/n1/mode/1up">it is difficult to interpret many of his statements as anything but lies</a>.  So, there are very good reasons to consider Bennett a compromised and untrustworthy source, generally.</p>

<p>Martha had been a faithful Saint, emigrating from England with her family (<a href="http://restorationbookstore.org/articles/nopolygamy/jsfp-vol2/2chp1.htm">arriving in Nauvoo the 25th of November, 1841</a>) to settle in Nauvoo.  All modern scholars (including those who deny that Joseph Smith himself was involved) agree that a proposition event took place.  This event then triggered Martha to tell her parents, causing them to spread news of the proposition among the Saints and that would convince them to leave Nauvoo even though they would leave two sisters and a brother-in-law behind.</p>

<h3 id="bennett-claims-to-have-met-with-brotherton-in-st-louis">Bennett claims to have met with Brotherton in St. Louis</h3>

<p>Bennett recorded his thoughts after visiting Martha in St. Louis and reports them in History of the Saints (<a href="https://archive.org/stream/historysaints00benngoog#page/n247">pg. 236</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Miss Brotherton is a very good-looking, amiable, and accomplished English
lady, of highly respectable parentage, cultivated intellect, and spotless
moral character …</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="bennett-claimed-martha-wrote-the-affidavit-herself">Bennett claimed Martha wrote the affidavit herself</h3>

<p>[LDS leaders] were foiled in their hopeful scheme [of winning Martha for Brigham], and utterly defeated by the determined resistance of their intended victim, as will be seen <strong>by the following graphic letter from her own pen</strong> …</p>

<p>Female literacy was at <a href="https://www1.umassd.edu/ir/resources/laboreducation/literacy.pdf">about 50% in England</a><sup id="fnref:britishlabourforce"><a href="#fn:britishlabourforce" class="footnote">1</a></sup> when Brotherton’s family left, so it is not unreasonable to believe that she was able to read and write.</p>

<h3 id="martha-does-not-mention-the-meeting-or-bennets-influence">Martha does not mention the meeting or Bennet’s influence</h3>

<p>In her letter to the St. Louis Bulletin, Martha does not refer to a private meeting between her and Bennett, instead opting to give the impression that her affidavit was merley in response to Bennett’s newspaper solicitation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DEAR SIR [to Bennett]: – I left Warsaw a short time since for this city, and having been called upon by you, <strong>through the “Sangamo Journal,”</strong> to come out and disclose to the world the facts of the case in relation to certain propositions made to me at Nauvoo, by some of the Mormon leaders, I now proceed to respond to the call, and discharge what I consider to be a duty devolving upon me as an innocent, but insulted and abused female.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Martha gives no indication that Bennett assisted her or influenced her in the preparation of her affidavit.</p>

<h3 id="affidavit-by-martha-alone-or-in-some-combination-with-bennett">Affidavit by Martha alone or in some combination with Bennett</h3>

<p>Taken together, the circumstantial evidence suggests that either Brotherton alone or Brotherton with some assistance or influence from Bennett were responsible for producing her affidavit.  It is difficult to preference one or the other possibility from clues outside the text of the affidavit itself.</p>

<p>The two possibilities listed above are acknowledged by Richard and Pamela Price, RLDS researchers who defended Joseph Smith against charges of polygamy.  They <a href="http://restorationbookstore.org/articles/nopolygamy/jsfp-vol2/2chp1.htm">write</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At that time Martha (or Martha and Bennett together) produced the … lengthy affidavit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The possible influence of Bennett on Brotherton’s affidavit may be determined
by examining Brotherton’s claims.  Bennett</p>

For charity coverd a multitude of Sins &amp; what many people called sin was not sin &amp; he did many things to break down superstition &amp; he would break it down.
