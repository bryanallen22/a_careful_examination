    <p>Summary: The original journal entry that had Joseph forbidding polygamy and wanting to try people for practicing or teaching it was drastically altered by later Church historians to countenance polygamy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Joseph Smith’s Journal <a href="https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/d6ee663e933a8cb01b79ddc33fe1232ac3ef12e5/documents/polygamy/oct5-1843/manuscript-history-of-the-church-rough-draft-oct-5-1843-2-720px.jpg">entry from the 5th of October 1843</a> reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Evening at home and walked up and down the street with my scribe.  Gave inst[r]uction to try those who were preaching teaching or practicing the doctrine of plurality of wives. on this Law. Joseph forbids it. and the practice ther[e]of— No man shall have but one wife.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, <a href="https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/d6ee663e933a8cb01b79ddc33fe1232ac3ef12e5/documents/polygamy/oct5-1843/original-journal-entry-anonymous.jpg">see this image</a>.</p>

<p>This journal entry was formerly hosted at the Joseph Smith Papers project at this link: http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/history-draft-1-march-31-december-1843&amp;p=144#!/paperSummary/history-draft-1-march-31-december-1843&amp;p=143</p>

<p>The document was later revised (I believe the JSP propject editors put the alteration at around 1850ish? [need to get exact date and citation]) to read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Evening at home and walked up and down the street with my scribe. Gave inst[r]uction to try those who were preaching teaching or practicing the doctrin of plurality of wives. on this law for according to the law i hold the keys of this power in the last days, for there is never but one on earth at a time on whom the power? and the keys are conferred – and I have continually said Joseph forbids it. and the practice ther[e]of No man shall have but one wife at a time unless the Lord directs otherwise</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See an image of the resulting manuscript of <a href="https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/d6ee663e933a8cb01b79ddc33fe1232ac3ef12e5/documents/polygamy/oct5-1843/manuscript-history-of-the-church-october-5-1843-d1-720px.jpg">here</a>.</p>

<p>The final print version, found in <a href="https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-6-chapter-2">History of the Church 6:2 as published at BYU Studies</a>, reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Evening, at home, and walked up and down the streets with my scribe. Gave instructions to try those persons who were preaching, teaching, or practicing the doctrine of plurality of wives: for, according to the law, I hold the keys of this power in the last days; for there is never but one on earth at a time on whom the power and its keys are conferred; <em>and I have constantly said no man shall have but one wife at a time, unless the Lord directs otherwise.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Possible interpretations of this event:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Smith was honest and later leaders were <strong>not</strong> honest - Joseph Smith was not lying and later leaders of the Church altered the meaning of Joseph’s words to contravene their original meaning.</li>
  <li>Smith was <strong>not</strong> honest and later leaders were honest - Joseph was prevaricating and later leaders of the Church altered the meaning of Joseph’s words to fit with Joseph’s original <em>intent</em> (i.e., polygamy was okay in certain circumstances).</li>
  <li>Smith was <strong>not</strong> honest and later leaders were <strong>not</strong> honest - Joseph Smith lied about polygamy and later leaders dishonestly altered the meaning of Smith’s deceitful statement.</li>
  <li>Smith was honest and later leaders were honest - Joseph was issuing a <em>tactical</em> mandate (<a href="http://www.millennialstar.org/commentary-on-joseph-smiths-monogamy/">described here</a>).</li>
