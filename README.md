# A Careful Examination: investigating LDS truth-claims and thinking

This repo contains a collection of my writing and thinking on LDS truth claims and the consequences of Church membership.  I have undertaken this investigation carefully and with as much objectivity as I was capable.[1]  If I am mistaken in what I have written or the conclusions I have drawn, then please do not hesitate to offer me correction.

My investigation has been motivated by the idea that if the claims of the Church are indeed true, then comprehensive investigation should bear that out.  The fundamental spirit of Mormonism is to seek goodness and [truth](http://ldstruthquotes.tumblr.com/), and I offer this work to others in that spirit.

[1] This repo is focused primarily on accumulating data and arguments which support alternative models of LDS truth claims.  Such an accumulation is necessary because the LDS Church avoids alternative models: for instance, [Dallin H. Oaks taught](http://www.scottwoodward.org/Talks/html/Oaks,%20Dallin%20H/OaksDH_ReadingChurchHistory.html), "balance is telling both sides.  This is not the mission of official Church literature..."  For my part, where relevant, I have explicitly represented the official and apologetic positions.  In general, please consult [lds.org](https://lds.org/) for data and arguments supporting the official model and [these additional Church suggested resources](https://www.lds.org/si/objective/doctrinal-mastery/gospel-sources?lang=eng) for details of the apologetic model.
