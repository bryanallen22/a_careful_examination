# A Careful Examination: investigating LDS truth-claims and thinking

This is a collection of my writing and thinking on LDS truth claims and the consequences of Church membership.  I have undertaken this investigation carefully and with as much objectivity as I was capable.  If I am mistaken in what I have written or the conclusions I have drawn, then please do not hesitate to offer me correction.

My investigation has been motivated by the idea that if the claims of the Church are indeed true, then comprehensive investigation should bear that out.  The fundamental spirit of Mormonism is to seek goodness and [truth](http://ldstruthquotes.tumblr.com/), and I offer this work to others in that spirit.
