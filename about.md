This site is a collection of resources, research, and thoughts on the truth-claims, teachings, and culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (referred to as "the LDS Church" herein).

I have undertaken this investigation carefully and with as much objectivity as I was capable.[^objectivity]  If I am mistaken in what I have written or the conclusions I have drawn, then please do not hesitate to offer me correction (email in the footer of every page).

[^objectivity]: This repo is focused primarily on accumulating data and arguments which support alternative models of LDS truth claims.  Such an accumulation is necessary because the LDS Church tends to avoid discussing alternative models in any depth.  For instance, [Dallin H.

    For my part, where relevant, I have explicitly represented the official and apologetic positions.  In general, please consult [lds.org](https://lds.org/) for data and arguments supporting the official model and [these additional Church suggested resources](https://www.lds.org/si/objective/doctrinal-mastery/gospel-sources?lang=eng) for details of the apologetic model.  When the LDS Church carefully compiles data on and fully articulates the strength of alternative models for its truth-claims, then this site will be unnecessary.
