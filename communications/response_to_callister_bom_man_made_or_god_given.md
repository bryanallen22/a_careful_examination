[still in rough draft form; needs to be completed]

On many levels I enjoyed listening to and studying Tad Callister's talk.  I think he does well in pointing out failures in some (mostly older) naturalist theories to account for data relevant to the creation of the Book of Mormon (BoM).  And, although I don't find it as compelling as he might, I also think his case for the unique doctrines and perspective of the Book of Mormon is an important defense for believing members to make of the BoM.  Most of his points are clearly cited, and that is commendable and aids in meaningful scholarly dialogue.  At the very least, even though I will present some counterpoints and may conclude differently than Callister on this topic, I think the _kind_ of introspection and investigation his talk represents is important for LDS leaders and members to engage in.

> It is good to be with you today. I love BYU. It is where I attended school, where I met my wonderful wife, and where all six of our children have attended.

While it's neither here nor there, I also love BYU.  All eight of my siblings and I (so nine in total) graduated from BYU.  As either a professor or a student I spent close to a quarter of my life there.  I also met my wife there, and like Callister, I have six children.

> ... Because the Book of Mormon is “the keystone of our religion,” as described by Joseph Smith, **the Church rises or falls on the truth of it.** (emphasis added)

I agree.  If you finish the end of this discussion and you are confident that the BoM is the product of an early 1800s mind, then the Church is likewise not veridical in the manner in which it is often suggested by members.

> As a result, if the Book of Mormon can be proved to be man-made, then the Church is man-made. On the other hand, if its origin is God-given, then Joseph Smith was a prophet, and if he was a prophet, then The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true. It is that simple.

I agree.

> Once we have a foundational testimony of the Book of Mormon, then any question or challenge we confront in life, however difficult it may seem, can be approached with faith, not doubt. Why? Because the keystone of our religion—the Book of Mormon and its witness of Jesus Christ—has also become the keystone of our testimony, which keystone holds our testimony securely in place.

Other faiths (e.g., [FLDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalist_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-Day_Saints), [AUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_United_Brethren)) also hold the Book of Mormon to be the word of God, so perhaps it is not as trivial as Callister makes it out to be?

> Thus the Book of Mormon has become the focal point of attack by many of our critics: disprove the Book of Mormon and you disprove the Church and undermine testimonies.

Many of us who no longer believe the truth-claims of the LDS Church are merely taking to heart the advice of Orson Pratt:

> If, after a rigid examination, it [the Book of Mormon] be found an imposition, should be extensively published to the world as such; **the evidences and arguments upon which the imposture was detected, should be clearly and logically stated**, that those who have been sincerely yet unfortunately deceived, may perceive the nature of the deception, and be reclaimed, - and that those who continue to publish the delusion, may be exposed and silenced, not by physical force, neither by persecutions, bare assertions, nor ridicule, **but by strong and powerful arguments — by evidences adduced from scripture and reason**.

> But this is no easy task---in fact, it is impossible, because the Book of Mormon is true.

Callister is about to present evidence to bolster testimonies of the BoM, but he seems to have begun with the conclusion in mind.  Perhaps our belief in the truth of the BoM should be conditioned on the totality of evidence for and against its authenticity?  Nonetheless, I do not begrudge him statements like these in a devotional address to believing members.

> Eleven witnesses, in addition to Joseph Smith, saw the gold plates

The witnesses and the two statements included in the BoM are not without significant credibility problems (see [here](http://www.mormonthink.com/witnessesweb.htm) and [chapter 3 of Letter for My Wife](http://www.letterformywife.com/wp-content/letter/Letter_For_My_Wife.pdf)).

> millions of believers have testified of its truthfulness, and the book is readily available for examination.

Billions will testify of the truthfulness of the Quran.  Millions will testify of the truthfulness of Ellen White's revelations, the truthfulness of Dianetics, and there are many devout followers ready to swear by [many other holy books](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/4wiv06/the_other_holy_books_and_spiritual_claims_book_of/) (consider [these video testimonies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3EfXz5VzR8)).

> Critics must either dismiss the Book of Mormon with a sheepish shrug or produce a viable alternative to Joseph Smith’s account; namely, that he translated it by the gift and power of God.

I will present a few viable alternatives which are consistent with much of the historical data and which may be the best explanations for the resonance of the book with early 1800s thought.  The reader may then judge whether the BoM is best viewed as a book translated with the help of an omniscient being or if it seems to represent the product of an early 1800s mind.

> ARGUMENT 1: JOSEPH SMITH, ALLEGED TO BE AN IGNORANT MAN, WROTE THE BOOK OF MORMON

This argument is really a subset of argument 5, and 

> ARGUMENT 2: SOMEONE ELSE WROTE IT

> Accordingly, some critics proposed the theory that Joseph Smith conspired with someone who had the education, intelligence, and skills to write the Book of Mormon.[6] One candidate for its authorship was Oliver Cowdery. After all, he was a schoolteacher, a scribe, and later a lawyer. But a major problem arose for the critics: Oliver never claimed to have written any portion of the book; in fact, he testified to the contrary:

> I wrote, with my own pen, the entire Book of Mormon (save a few pages) as it fell from the lips of the Prophet Joseph Smith, as he translated it by the gift and power of God. . . . That book is true.[7]

The first argument presented seems very weak: if Oliver Cowdery were a conspirator, then we would expect him to lie about Joseph's abilities.  If he were one of those duped by process, then he would testify that it was true.

The possibility that Cowdery was a co-conspirator must be considered, particularly based on how he discussed the translation.  Several third party observers, including Emma, are adamant that Joseph used hist seer-stone in a hat as the primary translation method (employed for nearly the entirety of the BoM as it exists today), but Cowdery always uses the same phrases as Joseph did and never mentions the seer stone or the hat.  [For instance](https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng#21), Cowdery testified under oath in 1831 that "found with the plates, from which he translated his book, two transparent stones, resembling glass, set in silver bows. That by looking through these, he was able to read in English, the reformed Egyptian characters, which were engraved on the plates." And in an interview in 1830 that the translation was performed with "two transparent stones in the form of spectacles thro which the translator looked on the engraving." (See [Welch](https://archive.bookofmormoncentral.org/sites/default/files/archive-files/pdf/welch/2016-04-11/welch_the_miraculous_translation_of_the_book_of_mormon_opening_the_heavens.pdf) for other examples of Cowdery's testimony).

The fact that Cowdery never speaks of the translation in similar terms to other witnesses suggests the possibility of co-conspiracy.  In addition, [a few witnesses claim that Cowdery was a co-conspirator](http://www.mormonthink.com/witnessesweb.htm#didoliver).

> Even though Oliver was excommunicated from the Church and it was some years before he returned, he remained true at all times to his testimony, even on his deathbed. As a result, this argument receives little acceptance today.[8]

If Oliver were duped, then we would not expect him to deny his testimony, even if he were excommunicated.  On the other hand, if it were a conspiracy, then blowing the whistle on the whole thing would also undermine his own credibility (i.e., he had been part of a conspiracy for many years) and arguably a person has much more to lose in blowing the whistle than they would have to gain.  So, this argument underestimates the cost to a whistleblower who may be in on the conspiracy.

> Another candidate for authorship of the Book of Mormon was Sidney Rigdon. He was a Protestant minister and theologian. The supreme irony of this argument, however, is that he was converted by the very book he was supposed to have written. Parley P. Pratt, a former member of Rigdon’s congregation, introduced him to the Book of Mormon in October 1830—about six months after the Book of Mormon had already been published.

Were Rigdon and Smith conspiring together to produce the BoM it would undermine their plan to be seen together, so it is not unreasonable that the two would make efforts to avoid being seen together.  Still, a reasonable amount of historical evidence [links Rigdon to the BoM before 1830](http://www.mormonthink.com/mormonstudiesrigdon.htm#21).

> Do we have any witnesses that this is how Sidney Rigdon was converted? We do. In fact, the historical evidence is compelling.[9]

Footnote nine points to an interview of Emma Smith by her son Joseph Smith III.  We have two options here: Emma was in on things, or she was being fooled, too.  Support for either option comes from the historical data.  In favor of the idea that Emma may have been lying comes from the fact that she clearly lied about polygamy during this [same interview only a few questions from the Rigdon question](http://www.mormonthink.com/files/emma-interview-1879.pdf).  The lds.org Nauvoo Polygamy Essay states:

> Emma approved, at least for a time, of four of Joseph Smith’s plural marriages in Nauvoo, and she accepted all four of those wives into her household. She may have approved of other marriages as well.

But if that is true (which there is abundant evidence it is the case) then she clearly lied in this same interview to her son:

> Q—What about the revelation on polygamy? Did Joseph Smith have anything like it? What of spiritual wifery?

> A.—There was no revelation on either polygamy, or spiritual wives. There were some rumors of something of the sort, of which I asked my husband. He assured me that all there was of it was, that, in a chat about plural wives, he had said, "Well, such a system might possibly be, if everybody was agreed to it, and would behave as they should; but they would not; and, besides, it was contrary to the will of heaven."

> No such thing as polygamy, or spiritual wifery, was taught, publicly or privately, before my husband's death, that I have now, or ever had any knowledge of.

> Q.—Did he not have other wives than yourself?

> A.—He had no other wife but me; nor did he to my knowledge ever have.

> Q—Did he not hold marital relation with women other than yourself?

> A.—He did not have improper relations with any woman that ever came to my knowledge.

> Q.—Was there nothing about spiritual wives that you recollect?

> A.—At one time my husband came to me and asked me if I had heard certain rumors about spiritual marriages, or anything of the kind; and assured me that if I had, that they were without foundation; that there was no such doctrine, and never should be with his knowledge, or consent. I know that he had no other wife or wives than myself, in any sense, either spiritual or otherwise.

The other option is that Emma was being fooled during the translation process by her husband.  Could Joseph have been fooling Emma, too, on the translation of the BoM?  The historical record indicates that at least on some matters Joseph had no problem keeping things from Emma.  [The Nauvoo polygamy essay](https://www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng) states: "But Emma likely did not know about all of Joseph's sealings".  Furthermore, Joseph had the Partridge sisters sealed to him a second time in order to hide the first sealings (which happened behind Emma's back) from Emma's knowledge, thus leading her to believe that the second sealing was the first (see Marquardt's [Emily on the Witness Stand](https://imgur.com/a/oscY6)).  This suggests that Joseph was not above performing an elaborate ritual for the purposes of deceiving his wife.

> First, Sidney Rigdon’s daughter, Nancy Rigdon Ellis, was eight years old when Parley P. Pratt and Oliver Cowdery presented her father with a copy of the Book of Mormon in their home. She said that she recalled the event because of the conflict that arose:

> I saw them hand [my father] the book, and I am as positive as can be that he never saw it before. He read it and examined it for about an hour and then threw it down and said he did not believe a word in it.[10]

> Later, however, he did accept the Book of Mormon, joined the Church, and became one of its leaders.

If Rigdon were co-conspiring with Joseph, how would his daughter know what manuscripts Rigdon was reading or working on?  First off, she would have been 6 or 7 during the manuscript creation process, and secondly, the manuscript would not have been bound in book form.  How many 6 or 7 year olds would know the provenance of unmarked documents their preacher father is reading or writing?  Thirdly, if Rigdon were willing to co-conspire to create the BoM, then it makes sense that he would have wanted to misdirect those around him into thinking he was encountering the book for the first time when it was presented to him.

> Second, Sidney Rigdon’s son John spoke to his father as he lay on his deathbed: “[Father], you owe it to me and to your family to tell [the truth about the Book of Mormon].”

> In other words, this is the day of reckoning; be totally honest before you go to the judgment bar.

> The son then recounted his father’s response: “My father looked at me a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: ‘My son, I can swear before high heaven that what I have told you about the origin of that book is true.’”

> After this tender moment, the son said, “I believed him.”[11]

> Later, John joined the Church, and thus another argument fell by the wayside.

This statement must be balanced by the fact that [Ridgon instructed his wife to burn all of his writings upon his death](http://www.mormonthink.com/mormonstudiesrigdon.htm#34).  If Rigdon had nothing to hide, then why have his writings all burned?  Also, a co-conspirator stands to lose much by admitting to being part of a significant conspiracy, even on their death-bed (we are creatures who seek meaning, so admitting to a lie on one's deathbed would be a horrible way to undermine the meaning of one's life).  Finally, some theories for the creation of the book (e.g., [the Lucy Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf3MluItWQE)) do not involve Rigdon in the manuscript creation.

> ARGUMENT 3: THE BOOK OF MORMON WAS PLAGIARIZED FROM OTHER BOOKS

> Other critics offered a different line of attack; namely, that Joseph Smith plagiarized the Book of Mormon (at least its historical content) from other existing books.

Most today hypothesize that the book was [a remix of ideas](https://www.bookofmormonorigins.com/) from Smith's milieu (whether synthesized by him or other authors).  However, there are good reasons to believe that whomever composed a proto-manuscript did, in fact, plagiarize from the Old and New Testaments (see "Significant Influences"[XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX]).

> One such theory alleged that Joseph Smith copied from the Solomon Spaulding manuscript—an unpublished manuscript written about 1812 by a man named Solomon Spaulding, who had once been a Protestant minister. It is a fictional account of ancient Romans who were sailing for England but were blown off course and landed in North America. When the critics were asked to produce the manuscript for comparison with the Book of Mormon, they conveniently claimed it was lost.[12]

I will note here that if Joseph were using the seer stone in the hat process for translation, then it would have been trivial for him to duplicate the lost 116 pages, or merely gaze into the stone and have God reveal to him the location of the lost 116 pages so they could be retrieved.  Lost manuscripts are more problematic to the orthodox story of the origin of the Book of Mormon than to Spaulding theories.

> However, with the passage of time, the manuscript was found in 1884 by a Mr. L. L. Rice. He found the alleged smoking gun in the personal historical papers of one of the very critics who had claimed the manuscript was lost. Knowing of its alleged connection to the Book of Mormon, Mr. Rice, Mr. James Fairchild, and others (none of whom were members of the LDS Church), reviewed it and concluded, “[We] compared it with the Book of Mormon and could detect no resemblance between the two, in general or in detail.[13]

> When I was in my twenties, I saw a notice from the Church History Department that stated that a copy of the Solomon Spaulding manuscript could be purchased for a dollar. I ordered a copy and likewise found no meaningful relationship whatsoever between the two books.[14]

Manuscript Story probably [did not correspond with "Manuscript Found"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spalding%E2%80%93Rigdon_theory_of_Book_of_Mormon_authorship#Hypothetical_lost_manuscript).  Also, search "Manuscript Found" [in Criddle's essay](http://www.mormonthink.com/mormonstudiesrigdon.htm).  Other hypotheses (i.e., [the Lucy Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf3MluItWQE)) do not rely on any Spaulding manuscript.

> With the demise of this argument, critics alleged that the supposed source for the Book of Mormon was another book titled View of the Hebrews, written by Ethan Smith in 1823. This book was an attempt to prove that the Native Americans were descendants of the lost ten tribes of Israel.[15] In essence, the critics claimed that this was the historical basis for the Book of Mormon.

> There is a simple test to determine if the Book of Mormon was copied from View of the Hebrews: simply compare the two books and decide for yourself.

I'm unware of any scholar who has ever argued that the Book of Mormon was "copied from" the View of the Hebrews (VOH), even though most believe the similarities in certain themes are self-evident.

You can access the book online [here](https://archive.org/stream/viewhebrewsexhi00smitgoog#page/n4/mode/2up).  Please note [the following similarities](https://i.redd.it/hiv3nejpu2611.png) (image from pgs. 17-20 of the CES Letter, version 2.0).  Regardless of B.H. Roberts' ultimate conclusion and belief (which is [debated by scholars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_of_the_Book_of_Mormon#Controversy_about_Roberts's_ultimate_beliefs)), the similarities were enough for Roberts to note:

> Did Ethan Smith’s View of the Hebrews furnish structural material for Joseph Smith’s Book of Mormon? It has been pointed out in these pages that there are many things in the former book that might well have suggested many major things in the other. Not a few things merely, one or two, or a half dozen, but many; and it is this fact of many things of similarity and the cumulative force of them that makes them so serious a menace to Joseph Smith’s story of the Book of Mormon’s origin. (page 240 of [Studies of the Book of Mormon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_of_the_Book_of_Mormon)).

Callister goes on:

> With complete academic honesty, B. H. Roberts, one of the leading scholars of the Church, listed some possible parallels[16] between the two books,

It is interesting that Callister points out Roberts' "complete academic honesty" when the book containing these parallels, [Studies of the Book of Mormon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_of_the_Book_of_Mormon), was commissioned by the First Presidency for internal consumption.  Were complete academic honesty a prime consideration for LDS leaders in general, then perhaps the LDS Church would have not waited for over 60 years to publish Roberts' work, and when they released it they would have also made his work easily accessible.  As it stands, his [Studies of the Book of Mormon](http://www.signaturebooks.com/product/studies-of-the-book-of-mormon/) is only available in a publication by Signature Books (a clearinghouse known for its critical stance).  Why prevent Latter-day Saints from accessing his academically honest work for so long, and why make his research so difficult for the average LDS reader to happen upon?

> but he then reached this conclusion: “I am taking the position that our faith is not only unshaken but unshakable in the Book of Mormon, and therefore we can look without fear upon all that can be said against it.”[17] Shortly before his death, Roberts ­further declared, “Ethan Smith played no part in the formation of the Book of Mormon.”[18]

The fact that Roberts' testimony must be defended is, perhaps, worth commenting on.  This historical record is clear that at least on some level Roberts struggled with the implications of his studies into potential criticism of the Book of Mormon (see Brigham Madsen's work [here](http://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V30N03_97.pdf) and [here](http://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V26N03_87.pdf)).  Roberts' studies were performed in the 1920s and only scratch the surface of the total scholarship available today which far more convincingly situates the Book of Mormon in the context of the early 1800s American milieu (see XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX).  If Roberts testimony was shaken then (even if only for a time), how much more devastating to belief in a historical BoM would unbiased investigation result in today?  Regardless, Callister and I both agree that a person should handle the primary evidence themselves in order to help them ascertain the potential authenticity of the BoM.

> I too have read View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon. Suffice it to say, these two books have totally different objectives and writing styles. For example, the Book of Mormon’s principal focus is to testify of Jesus Christ and His doctrine. Accordingly, the historical setting is not the focus, but it is rather the background music that gives context and emphasis to the doctrine. The principal focus, however, for View of the Hebrews is to historically connect the Native Americans to the ancient Hebrews. In addition, View of the Hebrews is a series of independent quotes and purported evidences to prove its theory. On the other hand, the Book of Mormon is a cohesive narrative—a story of families and prophets who struggled to live God’s word. The purpose and style of these two books is most disparate.[19]

It should be self-evident from the manner in which influence spreads among works of literature that a work may show possible influence from ideas in other books without necessarily duplicating the style or purpose of the influential book.  For instance, [numerous literary works are thought to have influenced Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien%27s_influences), but few of his books are mere copies of the influential works.

> Any honest reader can determine that for himself.

The implication here is that those who still see a potential _influence_ of View of the Hebrews in the Book of Mormon, even though they acknowledge differences in purpose of style, lack honesty.  Given [the number of similarities](https://i.redd.it/hiv3nejpu2611.png), such a conclusion seems hasty.

> ARGUMENT 4: JOSEPH SUFFERED FROM A MENTAL ILLNESS

Argument 4 is nearly 100 years old at this point.  No BoM generation theories I'm aware of today focus on this, so this boils down to--there once was a theory for how the Book of Mormon came to be that is no longer .

The fact that numerous theories have been advanced to explain the advent of the Book of Mormon suggests that there a several _possible_ ways in which the book could have been constructed which would reasonably fit the data.  After all, [numerous holy books](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/4wiv06/the_other_holy_books_and_spiritual_claims_book_of/) have been constructed over the past (none of which Callister accepts as fully genuine) and nothing about the Book of Mormon ties us irrevocably to the conclusion that the Book of Mormon required the intervention of an omnipotent being for its creation (presumably God could have, if he had wanted, produced a work of such monumental intelligence that all rational people were compelled to acknowledge that only an omniscient being could have produced it, but that cannot be said for the BoM).  Relatively uneducated people have created complex and coherent books in relatively short periods of time before and after the BoM.  The fact that some naturalistic explanations have fallen into disfavor over time mostly confirms that naturalists care about how well their models fit the data and are unafraid to discount theories based on evidence.  Some models fit the data better than others.

> ARGUMENT 5: JOSEPH SMITH WAS A CREATIVE GENIUS WHO, SHAPED BY HIS ENVIRONMENT, WROTE THE BOOK OF MORMON

> This argument has become a principal one used by many if not most critics today.

This theory is definitely bandied about at times, however, I am only aware of two major theories being presented today about the creation of the BoM ([Ridgdon theory](http://www.mormonthink.com/mormonstudiesrigdon.htm) and [the Lucy Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf3MluItWQE)) and both maintain that others were the primary authors of an original BoM proto-manuscript.

> It is a 180-degree turnabout from the premise of earlier critics; namely, that Joseph was illiterate, ignorant, and incapable of writing such a work on his own. In fact, we have come full circle, back to the same argument originally made by Alexander Campbell in 1831, except that now Joseph Smith is considered brilliant rather than ignorant.

Naturalists form theories to fit the data, and some ideas fall into disfavor.  How much data was available to Campbell in 1831 when forming his first theory about the creation of the BoM?

> Fawn Brodie, perhaps the chief proponent of this argument, opined that Joseph Smith, the unschooled farm boy, was a creative genius who, fashioned by his environment and the influence of local history books and resources, personally wrote the Book of Mormon. Remarkably, Fawn Brodie wrote:

> Never having written a line of fiction, [Joseph Smith] laid out for himself a task that would have given the most experienced novelist pause. But possibly because of this very inexperience he plunged into the story.[24]

> When one contemplates that assertion, it is nothing short of mind-boggling. Was it this same inexperience that helped him create hundreds of names, weave them into the most complex set of events, and then thread them together in a harmonious story resplendent with profound doctrinal insights? By her very acknowledgment of Joseph’s inexperience, she has magnified the improbability of Joseph writing this monumental work on his own.

While most theories today posit that others helped in or produced a proto-manuscript, several data points [suggest that Joseph _might_ have been capable of producing the BoM](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/285a45e5c99e5abf41c6910aad4419737cc57fc8/documents/book_of_mormon/translation/joseph_smith_uneducated.md).  So, while I agree that Joseph as sole author is a stretch, it does not seem wholly impossible, particularly if Joseph had been working on a manuscript for the years before the actual dictation event (which the timeline leaves room for, [especially considering the purported 4 years of preparation](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Question:_What_do_we_know_about_the_chronology_of_the_Book_of_Mormon_translation_and_publication%3F)).  LDS leaders often emphasize Joseph's unlearnedness, but they conveniently ignore the fact that he grew up in a home that emphasized personal educational and that he seems to have had an incredible mind.  Notice his command of rhetoric and repetition in his [letter to James Arlington Bennet in 1843](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-james-arlington-bennet-13-november-1843/1#full-transcript).

John Taylor [said of him](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-47?lang=eng):

> He was ignorant of letters as the world has it, but the most profoundly learned and intelligent man that I ever met in my life, and I have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles, been on different continents and mingled among all classes and creeds of people, yet I have never met a man so intelligent as he was.

And William E. McLellin [described his experience teaching Smith](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705280695/Inside-the-lost-McLellin-notebook.html) when Joseph attended schooling as an adult:

> He attended my High school during the winter of 1834. He attended my school and learned science all winter. I learned the strength of his mind as the study and principles of science. Hence I think I knew him. And I here say that he had one of strongest, well balanced, penetrating, and retentive minds of any with which I ever formed an acquaintance, among the thousands of my observation. Although when I took him into my school, he was without scientific knowledge or attainments.

If we are to believe Taylor and McLellin, then we are not dealing with typical intelligence.  Further, those engaged in automatic writing have been documented as [able to perform incredible feats of authorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_writing), so again, this theory does not necessarily exceed the realm of naturalistic possibility.

> Nonetheless, others have bought into this ­argument—lock, stock, and barrel. Why? Because they have nowhere else to go except to admit that Joseph translated the Book of Mormon by the gift and power of God—a place they desperately do not want to go.

This statement overstates the tightness of the case for the orthodox narrative of the coming forth of the BoM and completely ignores the strong case for viewing the BoM as a modern work (which will be discussed in more depth below).  In addition, this assumes that those who reject the BoM do so for some ulterior motive besides the fact that the BoM does not seem to them to be an ancient, historical document (i.e., the case for divine intervention and historical authenticity seems less compelling to them than the case that it was _somehow_ composed in the early 1800s).  Does Callister reject the authenticity of the Quran, the Bhagavad Gita, Dianetics, The Urantia Book, of The Book of Jaranek out of desperation, even though he likely has no other theory in mind for their creation than that the authors somehow made it up?

> These latter critics have added one more ingredient to the mix. Joseph Smith, they said, besides being a genius, was suffering from narcissistic personality disorder or dissociative disorder or depression.[25] Here we are back again to the mental disorder theories that proved so ineffective in the past.[26]

I'm not sure these are especially relevant to this analysis, but it is interesting that others have argued that Ellen White, another visionary in Joseph's relative time and vicinity, [may have also suffered from some similar symptoms](https://www.nonegw.org/egw33.shtml).  Callister apparently wants us to view these ideas as indicative of desperation, but I view them as naturalists covering potential explanatory ground.  Naturalists have no problem dropping theories if the data poorly support them, but it is to their credit that they are willing to genuinely consider the merit of various possibilities.

> In order to account for the history of the Book of Mormon, these critics claim that Joseph must have read or been conversant with a staggering number of books or ideas related to them. In fact, **one author has suggested that Joseph may have read or gleaned information from more than thirty books in nearby libraries in order to gather necessary information about the early Americans**.[27] 

In the emboldened text above, Callister is citing (#29) Vogel's [Indian Origins and the Book of Mormon](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/scripture-test/), but he seems to have not read Vogel's introduction where it clearly explains how he views the relationship of the various sources with Joseph Smith.  I think it is worth quoting Vogel at length so it may be appreciated how poorly Callister conveys Vogel's very thoughtful approach (emphasis added):

> ... For the most part I have explored two broad categories of writings: books motivated by theological issues—as is obviously the case with Ethan Smith’s View of the Hebrews (1823 and 1825)[16]—and those motivated by concerns more antiquarian than religious—such as John Yates’s and Joseph Moulton’s History of the State of New York (1824). **I have looked in these sources for arguments, stories, and questions which persisted over time and were thus picked up and repeatedly reworked**. I have also explored those sources which reached a broad audience–**books reprinted again and again**, for example, or excerpted or written about in popular periodicals and newspapers.

> **I have, of course, tried to include all sources which would have been available in the area where Joseph Smith grew up and later worked. These sources do not prove but merely suggest Joseph’s exposure to the subject**. Palmyra, where he grew up, was booming in the 1820s. In 1822 a section of the Erie Canal was completed between Rochester and Utica. The canal, which ran through the north end of the village of Palmyra, increased commerce and attracted many people to the area. Historian Horatio Gates Spafford wrote in 1824 that Palmyra “has long been a place of very considerable business, and is the third in rank in this [western] Country, and increasing rapidly.”[17] With a population of nearly 4,000, Palmyra had its own newspaper, the Palmyra Register, from 1817 to 1823, and the Wayne Sentinel thereafter. Palmyra had its own library after 1823, and nearby Manchester had had one since 1817. Several bookstores in Palmyra and vicinity sold a variety of publications at reasonable prices.[18]

> Books, of course, were not the only sources of information. Many things can be learned by word of mouth, what Mormon historian B. H. Roberts once called the fund of “common knowledge” inherited by individuals living in the same cultural setting.[19] Joseph Smith certainly inherited some of his attitudes and beliefs about the Indians from his ancestors–many of them leading citizens in New England’s Puritan community and members of the Congregational church. His maternal grandfather, Solomon Mack, fought against the Indians in the French and Indian Wars.[20] Moreover, Joseph may have learned about Indian origin [10] problems through popular channels of information such as circuit preachers, traveling lecturers, or community talk circulating in the country store, post office, and other public gathering places.

Hence, Callister seems to have misinterpreted Vogel's near-exhaustive demonstration of the penetrance of certain ideas in the psyche of Joseph Smith's time and place as a strawman which would require Joseph to have had direct contact with these books in order to have generated the BoM.  And, here again, Callister has failed to grapple with other multiple authorship theories which increases the likelihood that a given individual would have been exposed to a given idea about the Native Americans.

> The claim is then made that these books—or discussions of the same in newspapers or conversations—became the basis for the historical narrative in the Book of Mormon.[28]

Footnote 28 reads:

> Joseph Smith referred to View of the Hebrews in Times and Seasons in June 1842 (twelve years after the Book of Mormon was published); see Joseph Smith, “From Priest’s American Antiquities,” Times and Seasons 3, no. 15 (1 June 1842): 814.

The fact that Joseph referred to View of the Hebrews in 1842 merely confirms that these ideas were penetrating that environment.  The multi-author model does not require that Joseph had direct contact with View of the Hebrews (another author may have).  And the fact that he referenced the book later in his life does not preclude its direct or indirect influence on him (or another author) earlier.

> How might one counter this argument? Here is a list of questions that an honest seeker of truth might raise:

> • Is there a single reference—just one—in Joseph’s journals or written correspondence suggesting he might have read or had conversations concerning any of these historical sources before translating the Book of Mormon? No.[29]

> • Is there any evidence he visited the libraries where these books were supposedly located? No.

> • Did Emma Smith, who was married to him, ever comment that he referred to any of these books before the Book of Mormon was translated? No.

> • Is there any record that he had any of these books present when he translated the Book of Mormon? No.

Adam Clarke's [Commentary on the Bible](https://www.preteristarchive.com/Books/1810_clarke_commentary.html) was published originally in eight volumes between 1810 and 1826 and was "extensively circulated".  BYU Scholars recently concluded that [Clarke's commentary was copied from in the creation of Joseph Smith's Inspired Translation](http://jur.byu.edu/?p=21296) (aka, the JST).  Let's ask the above questions about Clarke's commentary, knowing that it was a source used in the production of the JST.

> • Is there a single reference—just one—in Joseph’s journals or written correspondence suggesting he might have read or had conversations concerning Clarke's Commentary before working on the JST? **[No](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/search?query=Clarke&sort=relevance&page=1&perpage=50&startdate=&enddate=&transcripts=false&issuggestion=false&types=documents-papers|documents-papers-documents|documents-papers-administrative|documents-papers-legal|documents-papers-histories|documents-papers-journals|related-materials|biographical-directory|geographical-directory|glossary|event)**.

> • Is there any evidence he visited the libraries where Clarke's commentary was supposedly located? **No**.

> • Did Emma Smith, who was married to him, (or any other scribe who helped with the JST) ever comment that he referred to Clarke's commentary before or during the production of the JST? **No**.

> • Is there any record that he had Clarke's commentary present when he produced the JST? **No**.

This thought experiment demonstrates that sources may be consulted without leaving the kind of record Callister demands.  It suggests a paucity of the historical record as it pertains to what people were reading and consulting and says little about the likelihood that individuals at the time were reading various books and engaging in various discussions on topics of relevance to the BoM.

The historical record strongly suggests that Palmyra and its immediate vicinity [were rich in available literature](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/ae94be0575fe50127e95f3deb5b63926a3e8441f/documents/book_of_mormon/palmyra_rich_in_books.md) on the kinds of topics (e.g., [indians](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/scripture-test/), [war and liberty](http://www.mormonthink.com/influences.htm#part2), and [religion](http://www.mormonthink.com/influences.htm#part3)) that may have influenced Joseph Smith _or other authors_.

Especially as it pertains to theological matters, we should remember that [Joseph Smith himself states](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&country=ca) that _as a young teenager_ he was attending "their several meetings as often as occasion would permit") perhaps daily (?) studying the Bible ("I was one day reading the Epistle of James"), and then bold enough to converse with the local preachers about religion ("I happened to be in company with one of the Methodist preachers, who was very active in the before mentioned religious excitement; and, conversing with him on the subject of religion").  How much could Joseph have gleaned on the topic of religion had he maintained such a trajectory over the next decade, particularly if he began reading other sources besides the Bible?

If we include other potential authors, then the sourcing problem seems to disappear since it seems at least highly plausible that these authors would have owned or would have read the kinds of sources that might have informed the creation of the BoM:

* Rigdon had been a Baptist pastor/preacher for nearly a decade by the time the BoM was published.
* Joseph's parents were both well educated---his father had "been a merchant and a teacher", his grandmother had been a schoolteacher and had taught Joseph's mother---and Hyrum had attended Dartmouth College as a teen. (respective sources: [father](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1971/07/joseph-smiths-home-environment?lang=eng), [grandmother and mother](https://books.google.com/books?id=A-cWAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA257#v=snippet&q=%22Lydia%20Gates%20Mack%2C%20was%20a%20school-teacher%20and%20taught%20his%20mother%22&f=false), [Hyrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrum_Smith#Early_life))

> How many "no"s does it take to expose the critics’ arguments as pure speculation—nothing more than sand castles that come crashing down when the first waves of honest questions appear on the scene.

As I just outlined, there seem to be some good reasons why "no"s to these questions would not immediately cause an honest investigator to believe the standard narrative.

> Do the critics expect us to believe that Joseph searched out and studied all these resources on Native American life; inhaled the related conversations on the topic; 

As Vogel demonstrated, many of these ideas _saturated_ that environment.  It seems more unbelievable to suggest that Smith (or other potential authors) somehow remained _unexposed_ to at least many of these ideas.

> ... winnowed out the irrelevant; organized the remainder into an intricate story involving hundreds of characters, numerous locations, and detailed war strategies; and then dictated it with perfect recollection, without any notes whatsoever—no outline, no three-by-five cards, nothing—a fact acknowledged even among the critics?[30]

This claim hinges on  ..XCVASDFASDFASGFASDFGA

> And during it all, no one remembered him going to these libraries, bringing any such books home, having any conversations concerning this research, or making any diary entries to the same. Where, I ask you, is the hard evidence?

> WHERE DID JOSEPH GET THE DOCTRINE?

> Even if Joseph had obtained historical facts from local libraries or community conversations—for which there is no substantiating evidence—the real issue still remains: Where did he get the deep and expansive doctrine taught in the Book of Mormon—much of which is contrary to the religious beliefs of his time?

It has been demonstrated that the vast majority of the doctrine taught in the Book of Mormon had close precursors, variants, or a deep foundation in, the theology and thought of the early 1800s (see [Book of Mormon parallels to 1800s thought](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/596260f90433378fc4015baa98db3252fd5f6df8/documents/book_of_mormon/links_to_parallels_to_1800s_theology.pdf).  My responses to specific doctrines Callister advances will also help to demonstrate this.

[[???? include this ???? ]] I will also mention ways in which these doctrines fail to approximate the kind of doctrine we'd expect ancient Israelites to be thinking about and how they fail to anticipate the ubiquitous conversations that would begin taking place within the next few decades after the BoM was published.  Collectively, these three together (1. parallel to early 1800s thought, 2. poor approximation of ancient Israelite thought, and 3. absence of awareness of upcoming conversations of huge import) make a strong case that the book was the product of an early 1800s mind and not ancient Israelites peering into the world at the end of the 2nd millenium.

> For example, contemporary Christianity taught that the Fall was a negative, not a positive, step forward, as taught in the Book of Mormon (see 2 Nephi 2).

As [pointed out by churchistrue](http://www.churchistrue.com/blog/tad-callister-byu-devotional-on-book-of-mormon-historicity/), the theological concept of [felix culpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_culpa) (or "blessed fall") was embodied in the ancient Catholic Paschal Vigil Mass [Exsultet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exsultet) and favored by Ambrose, Augustine, and Aquinas.  John Wycliffe, often [doted upon by LDS scholars](https://www.lds.org/search?lang=eng&query=wycliffe), spoke of the fortunate fall in multiple sermons, and wrote:

> it was a fortunate sin that Adam sinned and his descendants; therefore as a result of this the world was made better

Leibniz refers to felix culpa in his well-known work Theodicy, and John Milton includes a stanza clearly articulating a fortunate fall in Paradise Lost ([included in an Ensign article in 1976](https://www.lds.org/new-era/1976/01/john-milton-an-inspired-man?lang=eng)):

> The Fortunate Fall

> The poem is overridingly positive. In spite of the rebellion of angels, the evil designs of Satan against man, Adam’s disobedience, mankind’s foreseen history of bloodshed and sin, good triumphs over evil. In fact, more good will eventually result from the Fall than could have been possible without it. Realizing this near the end of the poem, Adam cries:

>    O goodness infinite, goodness immense!

>    That all this good of evil shall produce,

>    And evil turn to good; more wonderful

>    Than that which by creation first brought forth

>    Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,

>    Whether I should repent me now of sin

>    By mee done and occasion’d, or rejoice

>    Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring.

>    To God more glory; more good will to Men

>    From God, and over wrath grace shall abound.

>    (XII. 469–478)

Needless to say, Paradise Lost was hugely influential before and after Joseph Smith's time.  


> Likewise, contrary to contemporary beliefs, the Book of Mormon refers to a premortal existence in Alma 13 (see Alma 13:1--11)


> [a postmortal spirit world in Alma 40 (see Alma 40:11–14). Where did Joseph Smith get these profound doctrinal truths that were in fact contrary to the prevailing doctrinal teachings of his time?



> Where did he get the stunning sermon on faith in Alma 32? Or one of the greatest sermons ever recorded in all scripture on the Savior’s Atonement as delivered by King Benjamin (see Mosiah 2–5)? Or the allegory of the olive tree with all its complexity and doctrinal richness (see Jacob 5)? When I read that allegory, I have to map it out to follow its intricacies. Are we supposed to believe that Joseph Smith just dictated these sermons off the top of his head with no notes whatsoever?

> The doctrinal truths taught in the Book of Mormon are overwhelming evidence of its divine authenticity. Nephi prophesied that in our day an exceeding great many would stumble in finding the truth. Why? “Because of the many plain and precious things which have been taken out of the [Bible]” (1 Nephi 13:29). Here are but two examples of plain and precious doctrinal truths that were clarified or restored in the Book of Mormon:

> 1. Baptism. Much of the Christian world debates whether or not baptism is essential for salvation; they stumble over this issue. Let me read just one of many scriptures on this subject from the Book of Mormon: “[God] commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized in his name, . . . or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God” (2 Nephi 9:23). Should there be any debate about the necessity of baptism after that scripture? The Book of Mormon makes clear that which is unclear to much of the Christian world.

> The majority of the Christian world embraces sprinkling and pouring as legitimate modes of baptism. The Savior Himself addressed this issue in the Book of Mormon: “Then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth again out of the water” (3 Nephi 11:26; emphasis added). What is ambiguous for many is crystal clear in the Book of Mormon. Must one be baptized by authority, or is sincerity sufficient? Do we make covenants at the time of baptism, and, if so, what are those covenants? Should infants be baptized?

> Again and again the Book of Mormon comes to the rescue, giving answers and restoring many plain and precious truths about baptism that were distorted or lost during the Apostasy. How did Joseph Smith know all these answers when the rest of the Christian world was so confused? Because he received them by revelation from God as he translated the Book of Mormon.

> 2. What about Christ’s Atonement—the central doctrine of all Christianity? The clarity and expansiveness of this doctrine as taught in the Book of Mormon is beyond honest dispute. The Old and New Testaments have some scattered doctrinal gems on the Atonement (which we greatly appreciate and benefit from), but the Book of Mormon has numerous sermons---entire masterpiece---on the subject.  For example:

> a. 2 Nephi 2 is a mind-expanding sermon on the relationship between the Fall and Christ’s Atonement. 

2 Nephi 2 follows very closely [the anti-Pelagian arc of thought among Protestants of his time](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/documents/book_of_mormon/the_bom_and_the_twelve_points_of_pelagius.pdf).  Viewing the fall in a positive light was not original to the BoM.

In addition, [the poetry of David Hitchcock](https://archive.org/stream/poeticalworksda00hitcgoog#page/n30/mode/2up/search/Why+did+he+not+prevent+the+fall) (first brought to my attention [by Rick Grunder](http://www.rickgrunder.com/parallels.htm)) discusses the Fall in very similar terms as 2 Nephi (emphasis added):

    Could not the Almighty's power, display'd,
    Of man a different being made?
    **Why did he not prevent the fall,
    And thus immortalize us all**?
    Then man in uncorrupted state**,
    Had shun'd these desperate shafts of fate;
    **And free from every human wo,
    Had liv'd forever, here below**.
    ...        
    Could he, if all his art were spent,
    A being like himself invent?
    Or can his boasted skill create
    An insect of the smallest rate?
    And when created has he power
    To furnish life, or breath an hour?
    If not, why then attempt to scan
    The wisdom of that God who can?
    It so falls out, that death and sin
    Have since the fall of Adam been:
    That all the human race must die:
    For what? the universal cry.
    ...
    **Say not, that but for Adam's sin,
    Your race had all immortal been;
    And ever shun'd life's dreadful curse;
    But say perhaps your lot were worse
    Than now it is**: for 'tis inferr'd,
    That this event had ne'er occurr'd,
    Had not the Great Eternal All,
    **Foreseen it best that man should fall**:
    How then were men a happier race,
    Had no derangement e'er took place. [p. 33 ends]
    Knows man what would of course befel,
    Were he not suffer'd to rebel?
    Knows he, that earth's stupenduous [sic] frame,
    Had ever in existence came?
    Or that his now important rank,
    Were not an everlasting blank?

Less than three decades from the publication of the Book of Mormon, Darwin would publish The Origin of Species.  The theory of evolution and common descent both imply that humans came to be through evolutionary processes.  The BoM deals with the fall in very literal terms and even suggests that had Adam and Eve remained in the Garden of Eden that they would have had no children and remained in a state of innocence.  These two ideas are at some odds, and as the theory of evolution became more widespread it diverted a huge amount of theological focus from questions about the fall and infinite atonement to how to reconcile the bible with evolution (consider 

compare infinite atonement, fall of Adam, with Charles Darwin, evolution, origin of species

Later scientific studies would suggest the allegorical nature of the Tower of Babel and of a literal flood, yet the BoM treats these as literal events integral to the story arc.  Were the book written "for our day" we would expect Mormon at least a nod to the science that would undermine the literalness of these events.

> While the rest of the Christian world believes that the Fall was a step backward in man’s progress, Lehi taught us the truth—that the Fall coupled with the Atonement is a giant step forward.

_The idea of felix culpa was already addressed above._

> b. 2 Nephi 9:7 introduces for the first time the phrase "an infinite atonement," revealing the expansiveness, scope, and depth of Christ’s saving power.

The phrase "infinite atonement" [was at least somewhat commonplace](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22infinite+atonement%22&lr=lang_en&biw=956&bih=936&source=lnt&tbs=lr%3Alang_1en%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F1800%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F1830&tbm=bks) as were discussions similar to those found in the BoM on the nature of the atonement.

[The blogger churchistrue explained](http://www.churchistrue.com/blog/anachronistic-christian-doctrine-in-book-of-mormon/):

> In Joseph Smith’s day, we see a very mature dialogue on Christian subjects.  We have centuries of prior debate on topics such as original sin, free agency, infinite or finite nature of sin, infinite or finite nature of sacrifice of Jesus Christ, depravity of man, predestination, irresistible grace.  This discussion came naturally, with arguments being founded in the New Testament, and then added on.  Then someone adds on that.  Then someone combines a few different theories and adds something unique to it.  This is how ideas evolve.  We can trace ideas back through time to see the progression.   The Book of Mormon is beautiful in the sense that it distills these arguments in a masterful and logical way, taking the best of what was available and adding a few original concepts.  But it’s very difficult to assert that these Book of Mormon phrases and ideas could have come anciently and independently, without the body of work of centuries of Christian theologians to build upon.

Here are some good examples of the discussion occuring just previous to the Book of
Mormon (see [here](http://www.churchistrue.com/blog/anachronistic-christian-doctrine-in-book-of-mormon/) for more examples):

> The inference that you draw from my saying, that "I did not believe an **infinite atonement** necessary in order for God to be just in the pardon of sin," I think, wants propriety.  If it be my belief that the Son of God is not the eternal infinite God, still I think you have no right to declare it from any thing that I have written to you. You say, "that in order to support" my "favourite system," I "find it *necessary*."  How so?  If it require an **infinite atonement** made by an infinite God to save a part of the human family is it necessary to have a **finite atonement** by a finite person to save the whole? ([A Correspondence, by letters, between Samuel C. Loveland, Preacher of the Doctrine of Universal Salvation, and Rev. Joseph Laberee, Pastor of the Congregational Church and Society in Jerico, Vermont.  1818.

> I do not consider the necessity of an atonement as arising from the number of sins, but from the nature of them.  As the same *sun* which is necessary to enlighten the present inhabitants of the earth is sufficient to enlighten many millions more; and as the same perfect *obedience* of Christ which was necessary for the justification of one sinner, is sufficient to justify the millions that are saved; so, I apprehend the same **infinite atonement** would have been necessary for the salvation of one soul, consistently with justice, as for the salvation of a world. ([The Works of the Rev. Andrew Fuller, vol I. 1820.

>  But say the advocates of this doctrine, Jesus must be God and have made an **infinite atonement** for our sins, or our case is hopeless.  Why, what need for an **infinite atonement**?  If the sin of one man requires an infinite sacrifice, then there will be needed, just as many **infinite atonements** as there have been, or shall be sinners in the world; and just as many infinite Gods must become incarnate, and suffer in man's stead, as there will be sinners saved from infinite and endless wrath!!  Moreover if Christ have made an **infinite atonement** for the satisfaction of Divine justice, why will not all be saved?  Will God be unjust to himself?  Can he punish himself for no purpose?  O ye christians, when will ye admit the understanding God has given you, to vindicate the Divine character from such unhallowed aspersions?

Also note that the authenticity of the verses from Luke that seem to imply Jesus sweat blood is contested by many scholars (see [Blumell](http://rosetta.reltech.org/TC/v19/TC-2014-Blumell.pdf) and [Ehrman & Plunkett](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43716463?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)).

The interplay between obedience, devotion and guilt seems to have been a topic
of interest at the time.  For instance, consider John Gother's [Instructions
and Devotions for the Afflicted and Sick](https://books.google.com/books?id=eV1gAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA49&dq=In+this+one+Point+consists+the+Sum+of+Christian+Perfection&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjp2JfVxoHcAhUvja0KHdf1B6UQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22In%20this%20one%20Point%20consists%20the%20Sum%20of%20Christian%20Perfection%22&f=false) (pg 49):

> In this one Point consists the Sum of Christian Perfection, to receive whatever happens with a peaceable Mind, as coming from the Hand of God; to cast all our Care on him, because he watches over us, and nothing befalls us but according to his Appointment.  In this Will of God is grounded all the Quiet and Peace of a Christian.  And tho' it be Sin from ourselves and not from him, yet in our Repentance ought we to be very careful not to fall into any Anxiety or Disquiet of Mind.  We are to be heartily sorry indeed for having offended our God, and even with Tears strive to wash away our Guilt, but this Sorrow must not destroy our inward Peace; we must earnestly beg God's Mercy, who has permitted us to fall that so we might be sensible of our Weakness, that so we may ever go on with Fear, and not deceive ourselves in taking that to be ours which is only the Gift of God.  We must wait with Patience, and a contrite Heart, the Grace of Amendment;for he is our Lord, and will come when he pleases.  The faithful and prudent Servant desires nothing, but the Will of his Master; and in every thing that happens he says from his Heart, _It is so, Father, because thus it has seemed good to thee: Thy will be done._  I am ready to submit to all thy Decrees: Wilt thou that I be in Health, or in Sickness?  Wilt thou refresh me with thy Comforts, or cover me with Darkness?  Wilt thou that I abound, or be in Want?  What thou wilt, that I will: Do with me as thou pleasest:  This is the Temper of a Mind indifferent to all the Appointments of God, that makes a Christian ever cheerful and constant, and secures him against all Disquiets.

> Let my Soul be subject to my God; for who is there that resists him, and has Peace within?  If I am to keep Peace with all, let me in the first Place study to preserve my Peace with God; for I am but Dust and Ashes, and what can be sufficient to make me rebel against my Maker? Be thou my Help, O my God, and my Strength; support me in all Evils, and give me Patience; direct me in my Repentance, and whil I distrust myself, let me ever confide in thee; for thus only can I preserve my Peace with God.

> d. Alma 7 explains that the Savior suffered not only for our sins but also for our “pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind” (Alma 7:11).

  [The Book of Wonders, Marvellous and True. 1813. London.](https://books.google.com/books?id=vOgQAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA2-PA61&dq=%22suffer+temptations%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFnfOdvaDRAhWJxFQKHQIFAWsQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22suffer%20temptations%22&f=false) states:

> I became flesh and blood to dwell with men; and like man I became an infant of days, to be born of the woman.  Here I became in all things like man, to suffer temptations, to suffer persecution; to resemble man's weakness, by hiding myself. All this I have done, to be a judge of the infirmities of man, that I might be a judge of what man had to go through, and a clear judge of the different conduct in mankind.


> e. 3 Nephi 11 is the most powerful witness we have of the resurrected Lord, as 2,500 believers, consisting of men, women, and children (see 3 Nephi 17:25) came forth and “thrust their hands into his side,” felt “the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet,” and “did know of a surety and did bear record” (3 Nephi 11:15) that He was the Son of God. Who can read that account and not feel the witness of the Spirit testifying of its truthfulness?

> f. The Bible teaches us that, through the Atone­ment, Christ can make us clean; the Book of Mormon teaches us that, through the Atonement, Christ can also make us perfect (see Moroni 10:32–33).[31]

> Does anyone honestly believe that Joseph Smith somehow invented these profound doctrines with their compelling powers of reason, their mind-expanding insights, and their language, which is divinely eloquent? If these doctrines were the product of Joseph’s creative mind, one might ask, “Were there no other creative geniuses in the 1,800 years following Christ’s ministry who could produce similar doctrines?”

> The argument that Joseph Smith wrote the Book of Mormon is simply counter to the realities of life. It is one thing to have creative ideas; it is quite another to put them into a complex but coherent and harmonious whole, inundated with majestic doctrinal truths and all done in a single draft in less than ninety days. Joseph Smith’s wife, Emma, the person who knew him better than any other, confirmed this conclusion: “Joseph Smith [as a young man] could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter; let alone dictat[e] a book like the Book of Mormon.”[32]

> A PARABLE THAT COUNTERS THE ARGUMENTS PROPOSED BY CRITICS
In response to critics’ arguments as to the origin of the Book of Mormon, Hugh Nibley published the following parable:

> A young man once long ago claimed he had found a large diamond in his field as he was ploughing. He put the stone on display to the public free of charge, and everyone took sides. A psychologist showed, by citing some famous case studies, that the young man was suffering from a well-known form of delusion. An historian showed that other men have also claimed to have found diamonds in fields and been deceived. A geologist proved that there were no diamonds in the area but only quartz. . . . When asked to inspect the stone itself, the geologist declined with a weary, tolerant smile and a kindly shake of the head. . . . A sociologist showed that only three out of 177 florists’ assistants in four major cities believed the stone was genuine. A clergyman wrote a book to show that it was not the young man but someone else who had found the stone.

> Finally an indigent jeweler . . . pointed out that since the stone was still available for examination the answer to the question of whether it was a diamond or not had absolutely nothing to do with who found it, or whether the finder was honest or sane, or who believed him, or whether he would know a diamond from a brick . . . , but was to be answered simply and solely by putting the stone to certain well-known tests for diamonds. Experts on diamonds were called in. Some of them declared it genuine. The others made nervous jokes about it and declared that they could not very well jeopardize their dignity and reputations by appearing to take the thing too seriously. To hide the bad impression thus made, someone came out with the theory that the stone was really a synthetic diamond, very skilfully made, but a fake just the same. The objection to this is that the production of a good synthetic diamond [in that day and age] would have been an even more remarkable feat than the finding of a real one.[33]

> To suggest that Joseph Smith, a farm boy with little formal education, produced a synthetic work of God in 1829 that has baffled the brightest of critics for almost two centuries would be a more remarkable feat than the simple fact that he obtained the gold plates from an angel of God and translated them by the gift and power of God.

> OTHER EVIDENCES THAT THE BOOK OF MORMON IS NOT MAN-MADE

> What other evidence do we have that the Book of Mormon was a God-given translation and not a man-made creation? There are many evidences, but for the sake of time I refer to but one, because it is personal to me. Emma Smith gave the following testimony, as reported by her son Joseph Smith III:

> My belief is that the Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity—I have not the slightest doubt of it. I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, your father would dictate to me hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him. This was a usual thing for him to do. It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this; and, for one so ignorant and unlearned as he was, it was simply impossible.[34]

> This may seem insignificant to some, but to me it is astounding. For thirty-four years, as a lawyer, I regularly dictated to my secretary. As I did so, I was often interrupted by a phone call or a question. After such interruptions I would invariably ask my secretary, “Where was I?”

> But Joseph was not dictating or writing a new work; he was receiving revelation by the power of God and therefore did not need to ask, “Where was I?”

> When all is said and done, Joseph Smith’s explanation of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon is the only viable option on the table. Why? Because it is as true as true can be.[35]

> HOW WE CAN DISCOVER THE TRUTH OF A DIVINE WORK

> If I were to ask my good Christian friends how they unquestionably know the Bible is the word of God, I do not believe they would cite archaeological discoveries or linguistic connections with ancient Hebrew or Greek as their prime evidence; rather, they would make reference to the Spirit. It always comes back to the Spirit. The Spirit that helps me know the Bible is true is the very same Spirit that helps me know the Book of Mormon is true.[36]

> The Spirit is the decisive, determining factor—not archaeology, not linguistics, not DNA, and certainly not the theories of man. The Spirit is the only witness that is sure and certain and infallible.

> As a boy of about fifteen or sixteen, I was reading the story of the 2,000 sons of Helaman. I marveled at their bravery and the Lord’s protecting hand. Then a voice came to my mind: “That story is true.” Since then, other confirmations have come.[37]

> Why is it so important for you individually to gain a testimony of the Book of Mormon? Because if you do, it will become your personal iron rod. The mists of darkness may come and the unanswered questions may arise, but through it all you will have your iron rod to cling to—to keep you on the straight and narrow path that leads to eternal life.

> The Lord has promised that if we pray “with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto [us], by the power of the Holy Ghost” (Moroni 10:4). If we want the truth that badly, if we are willing to pay that price and be unrelenting in that quest, the answer will eventually come.

> By that promised power of the Holy Ghost I bear my personal witness that the Book of Mormon is God-given and that it is all it claims to be—a pure and powerful witness of Jesus Christ, His divinity, and His doctrine. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
