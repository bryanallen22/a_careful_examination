True that my choice of the word ‘originate’ is incorrect. The original claims
of the Book of Mormon being written by Joseph Smith were from critics during
his lifetime. 


> Brodie recycled those claims and they reappear in many of your arguments (copied from the KJV):

At what point do these simply become theories and not "recycled" from Brodie.  [FairMormon writes](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Anachronisms/Biblical/Deutero-Isaiah#Question:_How_do_we_explain_multiple_.22Isaiahs.22_and_the_Book_of_Mormon.3F) (emphasis added):

> When considering **the large quantity of KJV Bible quotations in the Book of Mormon** many **LDS scholars** have proposed a scenario like this:

> As Joseph was translating the text of the Book of Mormon, he would find himself translating something that he recognized as being roughly similar to texts from the Bible. This would occur most prominently when Nephi quotes from Isaiah.
Instead of translating Nephi's quotations of Isaiah, **Joseph, deferred to the KJV translation of those chapters**. **This may have been done to save time and to respect the quality of the KJV Bible. The chapters of Isaiah that we find in the Book of Mormon were taken largely by Joseph Smith from the KJV Bible, instead of being translated from Nephi's version of that text**. In other words, why reinvent the wheel when the work has already been done?

Are LDS scholars also now simply "recycling" Brodie?

, ). They rely on
the assumption that JS was a well-read scholar, a genius wordsmith, had a
photographic memory, could tell oral stories consisting of complex
civilizations (comparable to JRR Tolkien) without notes or repetition,




knew
that ancient texts were written on metal plates, fabricated plates to show to
11 others, formulated doctrinal answers to questions posed by preachers and
religious scholars of the day, all by the age of 24 while spending most of his
time farming or performing other physical labor to help keep his family out of
poverty. That story is much more fantastical than the claim that Joseph Smith
was inspired by God to translate (sometimes referred to as “interpret”) an
ancient text. As a foreign language teacher, I have no problem with phrases
used in the Book of Mormon translation that are also found in other sources.
The nature of translation is that words and phrases used are influenced by
knowledge and experience of the translator. I’ve read a lot of your links
(thank you for sharing). Here’s one I suggest that describes further the
intellectual and spiritual process of translating (interpreting) done by a
seer.
