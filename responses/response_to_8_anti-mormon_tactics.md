I want to try and address a few claims specifically.


1. I agree wholeheartedly that we should avoid believing in half-truths and lies.

I also agree that much critical literature is not nearly careful enough in how it represents the data, and they often fail to present alternative interpretations.  The same can also be said for pro-LDS literature.

When discussing half-truths and lies, one might also want to consider whether church leaders have ever misled or disseminated half-truths:

* manifesto
* polygamy denials
* Joseph Smith was sealed twice to the Partridge sisters to mislead Emma.

2. 

> When someone testifies that the Book of Mormon is true, Satan will say “But Joseph used a seer stone in a hat!” And? What does that have to do with where or not it is true? It is an irrelevant appeal.  It is a distraction.

I agree that it isn't the most important issue, but it is not irrelevant.  Joseph stated [source this] that he used a Urim and Thummim that he found with the plates.  But this varies from his original story.  So, if we are to believe his claim, then consistency in *how* he described its coming forth is relevant.  In addition, Joseph found the seer stone in a well and used the stone to dig for buried treasure.  His past use of the seer stone *is* relevant to the translation of the Book of Mormon because it *may* point to a pattern of motivation.

> "The Church is true." "But Brigham Young said..." Once again, saying something that is true, but irrelevant, detracts from the truth and is a lie.

One of the (few) ways we can determine that something is not true (in logical systems) is if it includes a [logical contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#In_formal_logic).  If Brigham Young said or did things that are genuinely irreconcilable with past or present leaders, then that is very relevant to those trying to evaluate whether the Church is true.

> Never let something distract you from your own testimony!

What if the evidence strongly suggests you ought to reconsider your testimony?
For instance, imagine if you tried to provide evidence to a member of the FLDS group that Warren Jeffs was not a prophet or they shouldn't be practicing polygamy and they responded: "never let something distract you from your own testimony!"  This is a thought-terminating cliche, and it is used abundantly across totalistic groups.

3. 

> Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God.” Then Satan or someone believing his anti, replies “But Joseph Smith did X, Y or Z!” Instead of addressing the question, “Is he or is he not a prophet?”

How does one go about determining if a person is a Prophet of God (or if prophets of God even exist)?  Various tests are provided in scripture.  The most famous of these was provided by Jesus himself:

> 15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

> 16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?

> 17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

> 18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can  a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

> 19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn  down, and cast into the fire.

> 20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

4. I agree that some claims critical of the LDS Church occassional fail to
   provide justification for why the absurd is also unlikely or untrue.

5. Argumentum Ad Verecundiam (Appeals to Authority)

Wikipedia defines Argument from Authority like this:

> An argument from authority (Latin: argumentum ad verecundiam), also called an appeal to authority, is a common type of argument which can be fallacious, such as when an authority is cited on a topic outside their area of expertise or when the authority cited is not a true expert.[1] On the other hand, a "true expert" can have valuable insight.

> But leading Egyptologists have proven that the papyri translation and the Book of Abraham don’t match up!”

Scholars are not 100% certain that the papyri we have is the papyri that was used to translate the Book of Abraham from.  However, [most of the evidence](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tz1iy4q7w39wvor/The%20Book%20of%20Abraham%20Criticisms%20Defenses%20and%20Implications.pdf) points to the Book of Abraham having been "translated" from the fragments that still exist.

Regardless, Joseph Smith points to *specific characters* on the facsimiles and gives a translation of those characters.  Devout BYU Egyptologists have looked at those same characters and [translated them](https://archive.org/details/SnsnTranslation).  The [translations do not match up](https://i.imgur.com/2a5sban.png).  That is a statement of fact.  We can certainly argue about what that means (as the [lds.org essay](https://www.lds.org/topics/translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham?lang=eng&old=true) does), but we cannot escape the fact that, [as the lds.org essay says](https://www.lds.org/topics/translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham?lang=eng&old=true), "Mormon and non-Mormon Egyptologists agree that the characters on the fragments do not match the translation given in the book of Abraham".

> When someone tries to appeal to the authority or knowledge of man rely upon the testimony of the Deity! When we hear something “new” does it change the witness we already have from the Holy Ghost? NO! Nothing should ever trump what the Holy Ghost has told us!

[Ballard counseling with scholars]

In addition, one of the main questions to consider is if elevating emotions
should be interpreted to mean that God is speaking to you.  This equivalency
has never been proven, and much data suggests we should be cautious about
equating good feelings with absolute truth.

Testimony stuff

6.

Most arguements rely on an implicit notion of what it means to be God.
Ideally, it would be explicit.

7. I agree, we shouldn't just accept an argument because many people do.

This applies equally to Mormons.

8. 

The reverse is also true:  I had a good experience in the Church, therefore
everyone had a good experience in the Church.

> At the end of the day, the only way to detect and prevent Satan’s lies are to gain a testimony from God Himself that this work is true.

Appeal to authority. appeal to population

> doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith.

> When someone gives you something that brings you darkness rather than light, ask yourself who is presenting this argument? Don’t let the words of apostate members shake your faith.

This is an ad homenien [sp?]

> Apostates are not a trustworthy source!

Hasty generalization.  Why can't apostates be a trustworthy source?  As an example, much of what was previously called an "anti-mormon lie" is now published on lds.org in the essays!

Also, if an apostate is biased against the Church, doesn't it stand to reason that Church members
are biased *for* the Church?  Perhaps the truth lies somewhere in-between?
