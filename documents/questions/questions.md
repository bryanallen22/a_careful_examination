[This is the same response I gave over on /r/exmormon, but this is a partially different crowd, so I thought I would put my questions here, also]

First off, this sounds like a fun idea.  Why not use youtube to share information and the things you believe?  I wish you the best in that endeavor.
These are questions potential converts, missionaries, and members of the Church should probably consider.

If any question contains incorrect information or is misleading in any way, please contact me and I will address it.

## Joseph Smith's Polygamy

### Sealing

1. Today, Latter-day Saints view the temple sealing ceremony as having the utmost significance.  Here are some examples: [The sealing ordinance links families eternally](https://www.lds.org/ensign/2011/09/the-sealing-ordinance-links-families-eternally?lang=eng), [Marriage in the Lord's Way](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1998/06/marriage-in-the-lords-way-part-one?lang=eng), ["The Sealing Power"](https://www.lds.org/media-library/video/2011-03-121-the-sealing-power?lang=eng)).

    * If sealing is such an important principle , why did Joseph never seal himself to his parents or children during his lifetime? ([according to LDS historian Brian Hales](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/66kueg/til_joseph_smith_was_never_sealed_to_his_parents/))
    * If sealing is such an important principle, why was Emma sealed to him after so many others (conservative estimates put the number somewhere upwards of 16 to 20 other women before he was sealed to Emma)? ([wiki: Joseph Smith's wives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Joseph_Smith%27s_wives))
    * If sealing is so important, why was Joseph Smith never sealed to Fanny Alger?  What was the point of that union? (see [Brian Hales' appendix](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Fanny-Alger-Appendix-D.pdf)).

1. After being sealed to Patty Sessions, Joseph Smith was later sealed to her daughter, Sylvia Sessions.  Why did Joseph need to be sealed to the daughter if he was already sealed to the mother (if the point of those sealings were merely dynastic)?

### Fanny Alger
    
1. In 1831 [Joseph Smith received a revelation stating](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/the-joseph-smith-revelations-14-appendix-e/), "For it is my will, that in time, ye should take unto you wives of the Lamanites and Nephites, that their posterity may become white, delightsome and Just..."  Does this revelation justify Joseph Smith's relationship with Fanny Alger?  If polygamy was restored in some form (outside the 1831 revelation) in order for Joseph to marry Fanny Alger, why do we have no record of that revelation? ([all we have is Levi Hancock's brief account](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/fanny-alger/)).  Was Fanny a Lamanite or Nephite?

1. Brian Hales wrote of Joseph's relationship with Fanny "it is obvious Emma did not believe the ceremony was valid and concluded the relationship was adulterous. Ironically, Oliver Cowdery, who Joseph summoned to diffuse the situation, sided with Emma, discounting the validity of the polygamous marriage" ([Fanny Alger](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/fanny-alger/) retrieved 2017-08-30).  Why did Joseph not get permission for his union with Fanny as required by [D&C 132:61](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.61)?

### Polyandry

1. For what purpose did Joseph Smith get sealed to other righteous men's wives? (e.g., [Zina Huntington](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/zina-diantha-huntington/), [Marinda Nancy Johnson Hyde](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/zina-diantha-huntington/))

1. What justified Joseph's sealing to a _happily_ newlywed, pregnant mother from a theological standpoint (referring to Zina Huntington)? ([wiki: Zina DH Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zina_D._H._Young))

1. Why did Zina Huntington become Brigham Young's wife after Joseph died and not Jacob's wife (especially consider that Jacob had children with Zina)? ([wiki: Zina DH Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zina_D._H._Young))

### Deception

1. Why was it okay for Joseph Smith to re-seal himself to the Partridge sisters [in order to hide the first sealings from Emma](https://imgur.com/a/oscY6)?

1. What made it okay for [Joseph Smith](https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/joseph-smiths-polygamy-denials/) (and [other early leaders](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/69633bdccecc8190bf00976faa6ad162083b2f59/documents/polygamy/denials/denial_analysis.pdf)) to repeatedly lie about their practice of polygamy (JS directly or implicitly denied practicing polygamy 5 times in his own words, and was responsible for 3 additional direct denials)?

### Miscellaneous

1. What was the point of a union with 14 year old Helen Mar Kimball?  If polyandrous unions were non-sexual, why couldn't Heber C. Kimball and his family have been sealed to Joseph via a polyandrous sealing to Vilate?

1. If Joseph was pressured into polygamy by an angel with a drawn sword, why did the angel not give sufficient instructions to ensure that polygamy and/or sealings were done "correctly"?  Also, it seems like there were many more pressing points in the history of the Church where divine direction was warranted---why did this angel only intervene with polygamy? (see [lds.org nauvoo polygamy essay](https://www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng))

1. [D&C 132:61](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.61) outlines three requirements for plural marriage to be "justified" and not adultery: 1) permission of first wife, 2) additional wives must be virgins, 3) additional wives not already married.  Why didn't Joseph follow any of these guidelines?  Did that make his unions adulterous?

## The Book of Mormon

Richard Bushman, well-known Mormon historian, [recently stated](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/49dfa3ec8b053e283fcd0643764907e3ccdf112c/documents/book_of_mormon/richard_bushman_on_nineteenth_century_theology_in_bom.pdf):

> ... there is phrasing everywhere--long phrases that if you google them you will find them in 19th century writings.  The theology of the Book of Mormon is very much 19th century theology, and it reads like a 19th century understanding of the Hebrew Bible as an Old Testament ...

And Blake Ostler, another well-known Mormon scholar, [has noted](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V20N01_68.pdf):

> Many Book of Mormon doctrines are best explained by the nineteenth-century theological milieu.

The number of similarities with early 1800s thought is extensive.  Virtually every doctrine or teaching in the Book of Mormon is represented in the writing of the early 1800s.

If the Book of Mormon is a historical record, and if we accept as accurate the stories of how it was translated ([stone / hat / words appeared until they were written correctly](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1993/07/a-treasured-testament?lang=eng)) why does it bear such a strong imprint of having been composed in the early 19th century?

If the book is ancient in origin, why did the author of the Book of Mormon quote or paraphrase New Testament scripture more often than Old Testament scripture, even before the NT was written? (see [King James Verses in the Book of Mormon](http://bookofmormondepot.com/kjv-verses/))

## Problems with Spiritual Confirmation

1. Why do members of other religions receive strong spiritual experiences confirming to them--specifically--that their religion is the correct religion?  (See data and discussion in [Testimony, Spiritual Experiences, and Truth: A Careful Examination](https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/testimony-spiritual-experiences-truth-careful-examination/))

1. Given how missionaries instruct members to pray about the Book of Mormon, in what fashion could a person arrive at the conclusion that the Book of Mormon is not true? ([logic diagram here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/4f3ac030a39f9e572b7a1835e93e8c30a2c2f9fa/documents/hermetically_sealed_stacked_deck/bom-standalone.pdf))

## Implications of the Priesthood Ban

The [Lowry Nelson letters](http://www.mormonstories.org/other/Lowry_Nelson_1st_Presidency_Exchange.pdf) and the [Stewart Udall letters](https://archive.org/stream/StewartUdallConscienceOfAJackMormon/StuartUdall-OpenLetterOnRaceAndConsequencesOfConscience#page/n0/mode/1up) demonstrate the unwavering confidence Church leaders of that time had in the divinity of the Black Priesthood/Temple ban and the doctrines and teachings supporting it.  This confidence is supported by a [1949 First Presidency Statement](http://en.fairmormon.org/Mormonism_and_racial_issues/Blacks_and_the_priesthood/Statements) and a [1969 First Presidency Letter](https://archive.org/stream/improvementera7302unse#page/n71/mode/2up).

Given the level of confidence leaders at that time had in the Priesthood/Temple ban, why should we have any confidence in Church leaders' positions today on things like homosexuality (homosexual SSM couples are in "apostasy" and the children of homosexuals may not be baptized without 1st presidency approval)?

Thank you for considering my questions.

## Joseph Smith and the Restoration

1. Why didn't Joseph Smith tell anyone about the First Vision for at least a dozen years?
1. Why didn't Joseph Smith tell anyone about the restoration of the Melchizedek Priesthood for several years?
