# Questions investigators (and members) may want to ask

## Introduction

These questions probe various aspects of the LDS Church's history and truth-claims.  The list was made for investigators to ask their missionaries or for those experiencing a faith crisis to ask their parents or ecclesiastical leaders (if they find any of these questions useful).

The LDS Church is capable of answering _many_ questions about its history and truth-claims, and many of the answers cast the Church in a positive light.  Those questions are important---and missionaries and ecclesiastical leaders will be quick to ask and answer them---but _difficult_ questions are similarly important for exploring the boundaries and potential contradictions found within LDS theology, history, and epistemology.  In science, at least, it is the question that is not easily answered that often motivates truth-seekers to find new---or refine existing---models describing reality.

If any question contains incorrect information or is misleading in any way, please contact me, and I will fix it.

## Joseph Smith's Polygamy

1. If sealing is such an important principle[^importance_of_sealing], why did Joseph never seal himself to his parents or children during his lifetime? ([according to LDS historian Brian Hales](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/66kueg/til_joseph_smith_was_never_sealed_to_his_parents/))

1. If sealing is such an important principle, why was Emma sealed to Joseph after so many others (conservative estimates put the number somewhere upwards of 16 to 20 other women before he was sealed to Emma)? (see [Biographies of Joseph's Plural Wives](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/))

1. After being sealed to [Patty Sessions](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/patty-bartlett/), Joseph Smith was later sealed to her daughter, [Sylvia Sessions](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/sylvia-sessions/), even though Sylvia was already married.  If sealings were merely to link together families, why would Joseph need to be sealed to the daughter, Sylvia, if he was already sealed to her mother?

### Fanny Alger
    
1. Brian Hales wrote of Joseph's relationship with Fanny "it is obvious Emma did not believe the ceremony was valid and concluded the relationship was adulterous. Ironically, Oliver Cowdery, who Joseph summoned to diffuse the situation, sided with Emma, discounting the validity of the polygamous marriage" ([Fanny Alger](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/fanny-alger/) retrieved 2017-08-30).  Why did Joseph not appear to get permission for his relationship with Fanny as suggested by [D&C 132:61](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.61)?

### Polyandry

1. For what purpose did Joseph Smith get sealed to other righteous men's wives? (e.g., [Zina Huntington](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/zina-diantha-huntington/), [Marinda Nancy Johnson Hyde](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/marinda-nancy-johnson/))  In particular, what justified Joseph's sealing to Zina Huntington, a _happily_ newlywed, pregnant mother? ([wiki: Zina DH Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zina_D._H._Young))

1.  To whom will [Zina Huntington](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/zina-diantha-huntington/)'s first children (those fathered by her first husband, Jacob) belong in the eternities?

1. Why did Zina Huntington become Brigham Young's wife after Joseph died and not Jacob's wife (especially consider that Jacob had children with Zina)? ([wiki: Zina DH Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zina_D._H._Young))

### Deception

1. Why was it okay for Joseph Smith to re-seal himself to the Partridge sisters [in order to hide the first sealings from Emma](https://imgur.com/a/oscY6)?

1. What made it okay for [Joseph Smith](https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/joseph-smiths-polygamy-denials/) (and [other early leaders](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/69633bdccecc8190bf00976faa6ad162083b2f59/documents/polygamy/denials/denial_analysis.pdf)) to repeatedly lie about their practice of polygamy (JS directly or implicitly denied practicing polygamy 5 times in his own words, and was responsible for 3 additional direct denials)?[^lie_rebuttal]

### Miscellaneous

1. What was the point of a union with 14 year old Helen Mar Kimball?  If polyandrous unions were non-sexual, why couldn't Heber C. Kimball and his family have been sealed to Joseph via a polyandrous sealing to Vilate?  (since apparently, a polyandrous sealing was sufficient with the Huntington and Hyde families)

1. If Joseph was pressured into polygamy by an angel with a drawn sword, why did the angel not give sufficient instructions to ensure that polygamy and/or sealings were done "correctly"?  Also, it seems like there were many more pressing points in the history of the Church where divine direction was warranted---why did this angel only intervene with polygamy? (see [lds.org nauvoo polygamy essay](https://www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng))

1. [D&C 132:61](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.61) outlines three requirements for plural marriage to be "justified" and not adultery: 1) permission of first wife, 2) additional wives must be virgins, 3) additional wives not already married.  Why didn't Joseph follow any of these guidelines?  Did that make his relationships adulterous according to this revelation?

## The Book of Mormon

Richard Bushman, well-known Mormon historian, [recently stated](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/49dfa3ec8b053e283fcd0643764907e3ccdf112c/documents/book_of_mormon/richard_bushman_on_nineteenth_century_theology_in_bom.pdf):

> ... there is phrasing everywhere--long phrases that if you google them you will find them in 19th century writings.  The theology of the Book of Mormon is very much 19th century theology, and it reads like a 19th century understanding of the Hebrew Bible as an Old Testament ...

And Blake Ostler, another well-known Mormon scholar, [has noted](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V20N01_68.pdf):

> Many Book of Mormon doctrines are best explained by the nineteenth-century theological milieu.

The number of similarities with early 1800s thought is extensive.  Virtually every doctrine or teaching in the Book of Mormon is represented in the writing of the early 1800s.

1. If the Book of Mormon is a historical record, and if we accept as accurate the stories of how it was translated ([stone / hat / words appeared until they were written correctly](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1993/07/a-treasured-testament?lang=eng)) why does it bear such a strong imprint of having been composed in the early 19th century?

1. Why are there errors in the Book of Mormon unique to the 1769 King James edition of the Bible that Joseph Smith's family possessed? (see [FairMormon article](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Translation_Errors_from_the_KJV))

1. If the book is ancient in origin, why did the author of the Book of Mormon quote or paraphrase New Testament scripture more often than Old Testament scripture, even before the NT was written? (see [King James Verses in the Book of Mormon](http://bookofmormondepot.com/kjv-verses/))

## The Book of Abraham

1.  In his translation of the facsimiles, Joseph pointed to [specific characters and gave a specific translation](https://imgur.com/2a5sban).  However, the characters on the facsimiles (_not_ the vignettes, but the characters describing the vignettes) have been translated by both [BYU](https://archive.org/stream/SnsnTranslation#page/n4/mode/1up) and non-Mormon scholars.  [The Book of Abraham lds.org essay](https://www.lds.org/topics/translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham?lang=eng) concedes: "the characters on the fragments do not match the translation given in the book of Abraham." Why do the translations of the characters on the vignettes not match up?

## Problems with Spiritual Confirmation

1. Why do members of other religions receive strong spiritual experiences confirming to them--specifically--that their religion is the correct religion?  (See [Spiritual Witnesses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJMSU8Qj6Go) and additional discussion in [Testimony, Spiritual Experiences, and Truth: A Careful Examination](https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/testimony-spiritual-experiences-truth-careful-examination/))

1. Given how missionaries instruct members to pray about the Book of Mormon (see [logic diagram](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/4f3ac030a39f9e572b7a1835e93e8c30a2c2f9fa/documents/hermetically_sealed_stacked_deck/bom-standalone.pdf)), in what fashion could a person arrive at the conclusion that the Book of Mormon is _not_ true?

## The Temple/Priesthood Ban

The [Lowry Nelson letters](http://www.mormonstories.org/other/Lowry_Nelson_1st_Presidency_Exchange.pdf) and the [Stewart Udall letters](https://archive.org/stream/StewartUdallConscienceOfAJackMormon/StuartUdall-OpenLetterOnRaceAndConsequencesOfConscience#page/n0/mode/1up) demonstrate the unwavering confidence Church leaders of that time had in the divinity of the Black Priesthood/Temple ban and the doctrines and teachings supporting it.  This confidence is supported by a [1949 First Presidency Statement](http://en.fairmormon.org/Mormonism_and_racial_issues/Blacks_and_the_priesthood/Statements) and a [1969 First Presidency Letter](https://archive.org/stream/improvementera7302unse#page/n71/mode/2up).

1. Given the level of confidence leaders at that time had in the Priesthood/Temple ban, why should we have confidence in Church leaders' position today on something like homosexuality (i.e., that homosexual SSM couples are in "apostasy" and the children of homosexuals may not be baptized without 1st presidency approval)?

## Joseph Smith and the Restoration

1. The Joseph Smith Papers Project [historical introduction to the 1832 First Vision](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-summer-1832/1#historical-intro) states "In the early 1830s, when this history was written, it appears that JS had not broadcast the details of his first vision of Deity. The history of the church, as it was then generally understood, began with the gold plates."  Why had Joseph Smith not told anyone about the First Vision until well after the founding of the Church?

1. Why didn't Joseph Smith tell anyone about the restoration of the Melchizedek Priesthood for several years? (see FairMormon [Date of the restoration of the Melchizedek priesthood](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Mormonism_and_priesthood/Restoration/Melchizedek/Date))

## Adam and Eve, 4000 BC, Garden of Eden in Missouri

The Church teaches [in 8 current manuals](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/397ebf7846fb325dbaa6fe3714131e2f07268777/documents/science/the_6000_year_problem.pdf) that Adam lived at approximately 4000 BC; Joseph Smith claimed that [Adam and Eve walked out of the Garden of Eden into Missouri, USA](http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith/Garden_of_Eden_in_Missouri), and modern leaders [affirm the physical, literal reality of Adam and Eve](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/where-justice-love-and-mercy-meet?lang=eng).  Finally, restored LDS scripture describes Adam and Eve tilling the ground immediately upon their explusion from the Garden of Eden (see [Moses 4:29](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.29)).  Please note that agriculture was not invented [until about 10,000 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution).

Many data points [support a migration out of Africa beginning about 70,000 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_human_migrations).  Aboriginal Australians likely migrated to Australia about 50,000 years ago, and extensive evidence shows migrations into the pacific islands [around 20,000 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Pacific_Islands#Philippines).  In addition, all human genetic sequence data and inferences about viable population size suggest that there was never a time when only two individuals brought forth the human race ([example1](https://newrepublic.com/article/115759/adam-eve-theologians-try-reconcile-science-and-fail), [example2](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/09/18/how-big-was-the-human-population-bottleneck-not-anything-close-to-2/)).

Also, please note that the various methods used to date these events are accepted as generally accurate by every BYU scientist who operates within these domains ([for example](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/4f3ac030a39f9e572b7a1835e93e8c30a2c2f9fa/documents/science/carbon14_dating_is_reliable.pdf)).  In part, that's because these methods are verified and calibrated by highly orthogonal measures of the passage of time (position of the stars relative to stonehenge, varve layers, speleothem deposition, tree-rings, etc).

1. In what fashion was Adam "the first man of all men" (Moses 1:34) and the "primal parent of our race" ([1909 FP statement](https://www.lds.org/ensign/2002/02/the-origin-of-man?lang=eng)) respective to the aborigines and Pacific Islanders?  Are those people descendants of Adam and Eve?  If not, what makes Adam and Eve their parent?
    
1. If Adam and Eve were literal people, what is one _possible_ time or place they _could_ have lived that is also compatible with our understanding of the human migration data?

1.  Throughout its history, the LDS Church has designated [upwards of 70 tribes, cultures, and peoples](https://lamanitetruth.wordpress.com/the-list/) as "Lamanite."  In response to [recent DNA analysis](https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-and-dna-studies?lang=eng), the church [changed the introduction of the Book of Mormon](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695226008/Debate-renewed-with-change-in-Book-of-Mormon-introduction.html) from "the Lamanites ... are the **principal** ancestors of the American Indians" to "the Lamanites... are **among** the ancestors of the American Indians."  What Native American or Pacific Island tribe or people may we properly designate as "Lamanite" today?  And, if we cannot identify any with confidence, to whom, exactly, was the Book of Mormon written (the [title page](https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-and-dna-studies?lang=eng) states that it was written to the Lamanites)?  Should the LDS Church apologize to any tribes or peoples who it may have improperly designated "Lamanite"?

## Patriarchal Blessings

1. Documentation exists that over 60 individuals have received patriarchal blessings indicating things like they will "remain until the second coming" or "not taste of death".  These people are all now dead[^dead_as_far_as_aware]. ([sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/6rctgu/if_your_patriarchal_blessing_indicates_you_will/))  Why should priesthood blessings or patriarchal blessings be trusted given these failures?  (Also, consider how easy it is [to make advice sound personal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6uj1ruTmGQ))

## Other Holy Books

1. What is the Book of Jeranek (Matthew Gill)?  What is "The Sealed Portion" (Nemelka)?  What is the Urantia Book?  How would you go about determining if those books (or a book like the Quran) are true?  Is this the same process you followed with the Book of Mormon?  Would you give those books as much time / study / prayer as you did the Book of Mormon before dismissing them as fraudulent?  Would you dismiss those who speak out against the validity of these books as "anti"?

[^importance_of_sealing]: Latter-day Saints view the temple sealing ceremony as having the utmost significance.  Here are some examples: [The sealing ordinance links families eternally](https://www.lds.org/ensign/2011/09/the-sealing-ordinance-links-families-eternally?lang=eng), [Marriage in the Lord's Way](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1998/06/marriage-in-the-lords-way-part-one?lang=eng), ["The Sealing Power"](https://www.lds.org/media-library/video/2011-03-121-the-sealing-power?lang=eng)).

[^lie_rebuttal]:  LDS apologist Brian Hales has attempted to argue that Joseph Smith wasn't lying about polygamy but using "carefully worded denials" instead (so he was "technically" honest).  I have examined that argument in great depth [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormonscholar/comments/66qepx/response_to_hales_challenge_please_show_me_even/).

[^dead_as_far_as_aware]: All these individuals are now dead as far as I'm aware---these are all from patriarchal blessings given before the 1900s, and I'm assuming we would likely know if any of them had somehow escaped death.
