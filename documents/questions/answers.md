Brigham Young.  The second child was fathered by Henry Jacobs, though.  Zina
was 8.5 months pregnant with her 2nd child from Henry when BY married her for
time.  (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/7gy2gk/zina_diantha_huntingtonjacobssmithyoung_as/dqmqeix/))

Brigham Young.  The child was Zina Presinda Young. (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/7gy2gk/zina_diantha_huntingtonjacobssmithyoung_as/dqmqeix/))

> \#5 To whom will Zina Huntingtonâ€™s children (those fathered by her first husband, Henry Jacobs, and the one fathered by Brigham Young) belong in the eternities?

Based on the fact that Joseph was sealed to Zina before each child was born and she was not sealed to any other husband, we must assume that all 3 of those children will belong to Joseph Smith.
