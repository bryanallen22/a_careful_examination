1. If sealing is so important, why was Joseph Smith likely never sealed to Fanny Alger?  What was the point of that union? (see [Brian Hales' appendix](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Fanny-Alger-Appendix-D.pdf)).

1. What strength of evidence exists for an 1831 revelation authorizing plural marriage (see [footnote #4 in the Nauvoo Polygamy essay](https://www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng#4))?  Approximately how many years passed before _anyone_ recounted such a revelation?  (see [The 1830s](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/history/polygamy-early-1830s/))

1. After being sealed to [Patty Sessions](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/patty-bartlett/), Joseph Smith was later sealed to her daughter, [Sylvia Sessions](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/sylvia-sessions/), even though Sylvia was already married.  If sealings were merely to link together families, why would Joseph need to be sealed to the daughter, Sylvia, if he was already sealed to her mother?

1. Joseph Smith was sealed a second time to each of the Partridge sisters ([Emily](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/emily-dow-partridge/) and [Eliza](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/eliza-partridge/)) in Emma's presence in order to hide the first sealings---which had occurred 3 months prior---from Emma.  [According to Emily](https://imgur.com/a/oscY6), "To save the [Smith] family trouble Brother Joseph thought it best to have another ceremony performed."  Is that [sufficient justification](https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-31-honesty?lang=eng#p17) for [duplicity](https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-31-honesty?lang=eng#p9)?  Did the concealment save the family trouble?  [Johnny Stephenson has done some research suggesting the approval of Emma was a concoction forced upon the Partridge sisters.  That means only one sealing was performed and it was behind Emma's back.  Emma never did approve of sealings to the Partridge Sisters]

## Other Holy Books

1. What is [the Book of Jeraneck](https://www.latterdaymormon.co.uk/book-of-jeraneck)?  What is [The Sealed Portion](http://www.marvelousworkandawonder.com/tsp/index.htm)?  What is [the Urantia Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Urantia_Book)?  How would a person go about determining if those books (or a book like the Quran) are true?  Is this the same process members are taught to follow with the Book of Mormon?  Should a person give those books as much time, study, and prayer as they did the Book of Mormon before dismissing them as fraudulent?  Should those who who point out possible contradictions and anachronisms in these books be labeled "anti"?

## DNA and the Book of Mormon

Throughout its history, the LDS Church has designated [upwards of 70 tribes, cultures, and peoples](https://lamanitetruth.wordpress.com/the-list/) as "Lamanite."  In response to [recent DNA analysis](https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-and-dna-studies?lang=eng), the church [changed the introduction of the Book of Mormon](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695226008/Debate-renewed-with-change-in-Book-of-Mormon-introduction.html) from "the Lamanites ... are the **principal** ancestors of the American Indians" to "the Lamanites... are **among** the ancestors of the American Indians."

1. What Native American or Pacific Island tribe or people may we properly designate as "Lamanite" today?  And, if we cannot identify any with confidence, to whom, exactly, was the Book of Mormon written?[^written_to_lamanites]  Should the LDS Church apologize to any tribes or peoples who it may have improperly designated "Lamanite"?
