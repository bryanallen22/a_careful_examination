> He came to our YSA Branch. Only young adults were welcome. As adult leaders we were relegated to the back row. He opened the meeting with jovial comments. He tried to come across as just a nice guy. He created an air of familiarity. The audience laughed and relaxed. Toward the end he left an apostolic blessing upon the congregation. He left. The audience stood and began visiting. It was a warm friendly atmosphere. Bednar then stormed back in, stood at the podium and rebuked the young adults for their loud laughter and chasing away the spirit. He then revoked the apostolic blessing. It was horrifying display of arrogance.
