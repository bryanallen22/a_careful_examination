Title: "That time Bednar made us all re-sing the opening hymn cuz he didn't like the way we sang it."

Post:

> This was about 10 years ago. I think it was a regional conference, but can't remember. I was completely checked out of the church at the time and just attending to keep my family off my back.

> Anyways, Bednar was the visiting GA and the main speaker. When it was his turn to get up and speak, he complains that we didn't sing the opening hymn good enough and he was disappointed. I can't even remember the hymn, but Bednar said it was supposed to be sung forcefully and joyfully and the crowd was neither forceful or joyful when they sang it.

> He calls the organist back up and says he wants us all to re-sing the song with a better attitude. He sits back down and the audience sings the song. When the song is done he tells us all that it was much better and then goes on to give his talk.

> I couldn't tell if Bednar having us re-sing the song was a douchey power trip, or a clever ploy at burning 10 minutes off the clock so he didn't have to speak his allotted 20 mins.

> Flash forward to church next Sunday and the Bishop gets up to remind us to be more mindful of the hymns and try to be more enthusiastic in our singing of them after hearing counsel about it from a prophet, seer, and revelator at last week's regional conference.

> LOL! Fucking cult...

> TL;DR Bednar is a Tool.
