Title: "The time Elder Bednar chastised two young girls in front of the whole stake."

Post:

> It was the end of our stake conference Bednar had given talks for his apostle visit.

> It was the closing hymn and I noticed two YSA Women stand up to sing. Keep in mind they were almost in the last row way back in the gym. The hymn ended and the member was about to walk up to the pulpit to give the closing prayer but Bednar stopped him and said: “I noticed two young women who took it upon themselves to stand up during the hymn. This is unacceptable. You must look to the brethren before doing such things. If the presiding authority is sitting, stay sitting. If he stands then stand. Brothers and sisters remember look to the brethren.”

> Although he didn’t call them out by name there were at least a hundred people who saw the young ladies standing. I noticed one of the girls crying and still sitting in the back long after the end of the meeting.

> This was one of the first times I every remember disagreeing with an apostle.
