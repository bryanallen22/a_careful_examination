[^amazon]: I have linked to amazon. I am not an affiliate of Amazon and this is not an affiliate link (i.e., I make nothing from linking to the book). The book was originally sold on the Deseret Book website ([broken link](https://deseretbook.com/p/bridges-ministering-to-those-who-question?variant_id=181882-paperback), sku: 5232777) but it is no longer sold there. I asked Deseret Book _why_ they dropped the book and if it would be available again. They gave a fairly generic response: "Thank you for your email. The book 'Bridges' is currently not available through Deseret Book, and we do not have upcoming information of when it will be. I see that you can purchase the book through Amazon or Barnes and Noble. Thanks for your time and have a good day!"
