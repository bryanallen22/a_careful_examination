### Exmo lex, first hand account

Exmo Lex admits to soaking [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0rsI9W9BsE&t=293s):

> It's obvious BS. No one does it and any who say they do it are lying.  Let's stop talking about it. 

> [pointing to self] I did it.  My husband and I soaked.  Why do you guys think I know about it.
> Why do you think I know for certain it happens.  Cheers to that
> embarrassment. Yes, I know soaking is a real thing because I, myself, have
> done it.  The reason people don't admit to it is because it is embarrassing
> as f\*\*\*.

She didn't know it was "soaking" at the time, but later learned the term associated with it.

### An LDS Sex therapist, third hand account

In a podcast I was listening to several years ago I heard an LDS sex therapist refer to clients who had admitted "soaking" to them. Despite trying, I have not been able to locate the podcast, but I am confident in my recollection.

_So, until I find the podcast, this is a third hand account._

### Anecdote of an LPHS proposition to soak, third hand account

From [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/11n27al/anecdotal_occurrence_of_actual_soaking_in_the/) on exmormon:

> Last night over dinner with our teenage kids the topic of "soaking" came up. After explaining it to my 14-year-old, and waiting for 5 minutes for him to stop giggling, I made the statement that it's funny but also most likely urban legend. At that point my 17-year-old interrupted to share an experience one of her "besties" shared with here where she said a few months ago she was propositioned to soak at a high school party of Lone Peak kids. That's how she even knows what soaking is. So apparently There is some kernel of truth to all the soaking stories.
