Exmo Lex admits to soaking [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0rsI9W9BsE&t=293s):

> It's obvious BS. No one does it and any who say they do it are lying.  Let's stop talking about it. 

> [pointing to self] I did it.  My husband and I soaked.  Why do you guys think I know about it.
> Why do you think I know for certain it happens.  Cheers to that
> embarassment. Yes, I know soaking is a real thing because I, myself, have
> done it.  The reason people don't admit to it is because it is embarassing
> as f\*\*\*.

She didn't know it was "soaking" at the time, but later learned the term
associated with it.

In a podcast I was listening to several years ago I heard an LDS sex therapist
refer to clients who had admitted "soaking" to them. I have not been able to
locate the podcast.
