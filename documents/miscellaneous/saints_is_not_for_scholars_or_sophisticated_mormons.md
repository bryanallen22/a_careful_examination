Patrick Mason addressed the target audience of the new narrative history book "Saints" [in a recent SLTrib article](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/09/04/mormon-church-publishes/):

> “Saints” is not for scholars or even sophisticated Mormons, said Patrick Mason, chair of Mormon studies at Claremont Graduate University. “This is for the person who has never picked up a book of church history or a volume of the Joseph Smith Papers Project — and is never going to.”

> It’s for members whose only exposure to Latter-day Saint history is the fictionalized series “The Work and the Glory,” he said, “or for new members who live in Brazil or Ghana.”

> It’s an internal document “for the faithful,” Mason said, “like a Sunday school.”
