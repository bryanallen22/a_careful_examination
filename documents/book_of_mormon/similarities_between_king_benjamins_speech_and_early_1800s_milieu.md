### 1829 BoM - Mosiah 3:19

> For ***the natural man is an enemy to God***, and has been ***from the fall of Adam***, and will be, forever and ever, unless he ***yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit***, and ***putteth off the natural man*** and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and ***becometh as a child, submissive***, ***meek***, ***humble***, patient, full of love, ***willing to submit to all things*** which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a ***child doth submit*** to his father.

## General similarities

There are many parallels between King Bejamin's speech (found in Mosiah 2–5) and phrases and ideas already present in Joseph Smith's early 1800s milieu, many of them in the 1769 King James Bible.
