## Introduction

Solomon Spalding wrote a historical romance whose manuscript was preserved, and this manuscript is referred to by scholars as the "Oberlin Manuscript" to avoid confusion about the name of the story and a possible second manuscript which has never been found.  Some claim that the Oberlin Manuscript was properly called "Manuscript Story---Conneaut Creek" but others that the Oberlin Manuscript was the story referred to as "Manuscript, Found", the name by which it is sometimes published.[^solomon_spalding]

Parallels between two texts may be coincidental, indirect (e.g.,
both from a common source or loosely generated through a shared cultural
milieu), or direct (one author having read and consciously or subconsciously
pulling from verbiage or themes from the other).  Generally, the more unlikely
the shared similarity and the more precise the parallel, the more likely that
some influence genuinely existed.  If parallels are found copiously in the
milieu, then it seems more reasonable to attribute the parallels to a shared
milieu than to direct influence; however, distinguishing between indirect and
shared cultural influence requires a fairly comprehensive appreciation of the
milieu.

In this essay, I point out points of similarity between the Book of Mormon and
the Oberlin Manscript (the 1885 publication by the RLDS Church[^date-suspect]). An analysis of the significance of the parallels (e.g.,
do these suggest a common source, shared cultural influence, or are merely
coincidences) is beyond the scope of this work.

  the arts of war", many bloody Battles fought, heroes "by thousands" "bite the dust." (pg 13):

* Introduced main character with name and learning (pg 14):

  "the watery grave". (pg 15)
