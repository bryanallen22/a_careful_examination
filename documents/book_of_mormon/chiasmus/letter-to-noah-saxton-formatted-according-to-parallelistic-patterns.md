### Introduction

Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon is frequently advanced by Latter-day Saint scholars as evidence favoring an ancient origin of the book ([for example](https://knowhy.bookofmormoncentral.org/knowhy/does-chiasmus-prove-anything-about-the-book-of-mormon)).

Various naturalistic mechanisms for the presence of chiasmus in the Book of Mormon may be contemplated [including](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/best-arguments-against-chiasmus-as-evidence-of-ancientness/):

1. appearance by chance alone
2. the author somehow gleaned the technique from one or more of the two popular Bible commentaries of that time which described inverted parallelism 
3. the author receiving commonplace training in rhetorical methods of the time such as anastrophe (inversion).

In the past few years, William Davis has advanced evidence and arguments suggesting that the Book of Mormon [exhibits patterns common to oral performance generally](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/86h814zv) (Oral Formulaic Theory) and also at least some patterns specific to the early
1800s (e.g., [laying down heads](https://uncpress.org/book/9781469655666/visions-in-a-seer-stone/)).

Oral Formulaic Theory may help make some sense of a few observations, especially the length of some chiastic structures (like Alma 36) and the fact that Joseph never pointed out the chiasms and parallelisms in the Book of Mormon.  If Joseph was the author of the Book of Mormon and Joseph naturally naturally employed these structures as part of the process of orally composing the Book of Mormon, then---to extend Davis's hypothesis further---we might expect Joseph to spontaneously utilize repetition (including inversion) as he composes other similar works orally, too, at least to some extent.

I recently happened upon [an 1833 letter from Joseph Smith to a newspaper editor](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letterbook-1/26#X6E0ADA17-5772-44B3-926B-9A889F221AEF) that, upon first blush, seemed somewhat reminiscent of the Book of Mormon in tone and style. Joseph was acting in a prophetic role, and so, while the letter seems to have been composed in his own voice, it also seems composed in an elevated, quasi-scriptural, style. I reasoned that such a composition would provide a potential test of the hypothesis that Joseph Smith might have been _naturally_ inclined to the _kinds_ of repetition observed in the Book of Mormon while composing works orally, especially while working in a "scriptural" register.

### Subjectivity

I am not a literary expert, but I have studied chiastic structures as an amateur (e.g., I read and studied Parry's "The Book of Mormon text Reformatted according to Parallelistic Patterns", [reviewed here](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1186&context=msr),  more than once).

Welch has defined criteria to measure the strength of a chiastic structure, but nonetheless there is some element of subjectivity in choosing parallels from any text (for instance, consider critiques of the structuring of Alma 36 by Wunderliii and William Davis).

I acknowledge that the emphasis of particular themes among various portions of
the text (aka "cherry-picking") grants a formatter some liberty in structuring
the text. Still, my efforts do not seem completely disproportional to the
effort of LDS scholars to tease out chiastic structure among multiple possible
inherent structures.

Certain chiasms---and proposed phrase pairings within chiasms---exhibited differing strength to my mind, and various alternative structures were possible to construct.  Still, most of the structures I identified seem to have some grounding in thematic or phrase repetition that seems intrinsic to the text itself.  While the validity of any particular structure and many of the pairings may be rightfully questioned, the fact that significant repetition that lends itself to the generation of putative poetic structure seems to be a property intrinsic to this text and not one completely imposed by myself.

Mr. Editor Sir,


A Considering the <b>Liberal prisciples</b> [principles] upon which your
  interesting and valuable paper is published

    B and myself being <b>a subscriber</b>

        C and feeling a deep intrist [interest] in the cause of Zion and in
          the happiness of my brethren of mankind I cheerfully take up my pen to
          contribute my mite at this every <b>[very] interesting and important
          period</b>

            D For some <b>length of time</b>

                E I have been car[e]fully <b>viewing the state of things</b> as
                  now appear throug[h]out our christian Land

                    F and have looked at it with <b>feelings of the most painful
                      anxiety</b>

                        G while <b>upon the one hand</b>

                            H beholding the manifested <b>withdrawal of Gods
                              holy Spirit</b>

                                I and the <b>vail</b> of stupidity

                                I' which seems to be <b>drawn</b>

                            H over <b>the hearts of the people</b>

                        G' and <b>upon the other hand</b>

                    F' beholding <b>the Judgments of God</b> that have swept and
                       are still sweeping hundreds and thousands of our race 
                       (and <b>I fear</b> unprepared) down to the shades of death 

                E' with this <b>solemn and alarming fact before me</b> I am led to
                   exclaim [“]O that my head were waters and mine ey[e]s a
                   fountain of tears

            D' that I might weep <b>day and night</b> &c.”

        C' I think that it is <b>high time</b> 

    B' for a christian world to <b>awake out of sleep and cry mightely to that
       God</b> day and night

A' whose anger we have <b>Justly incured</b>.


A Are not these things a sufficient stimulant to <b>arouse the faculties</b>

    B and call forth <b>the energies</b> of evry man woman and child that poseses
     <b>feeling of sympathy</b> for his fellow[s]

        C or that is in any degree endeared to <b>the bud[d]ing cause of our
          glorious Lord</b>;

            D I leave an inteligent community to answer this important
              question with a confession that this is what has caused me to
              overlook my own inability and <b>expose my weakness to a learned
              world</b>

                E but trusting in that God who has said these things are <b>hid
                  from the wise and prudent</b>

                    F and <b>reve[a]led unto babes</b>

                        G I step forth into the field to tell you <b>what the
                          Lord is doing and what you must do</b> to enjoy the
                          smiles of your saviour in these last day[s]— 

                            H The <b>time has at last come arived</b>

                                I when the God of Abraham of Isaac and of
                                  Jacob <b>has set</b> his hand again the seccond
                                  time <b>to recover the remnants of his people</b>

                                    J which <b>have been left</b>
                                        from Assyria,
                                        and from Egypt
                                        and from Pathros &.c.
                                        and from the Islands of the sea 

                                    J' and with them <b>to bring in</b> the fulness
                                       of the Gentiles

                                I' and <b>establish that covenant with them</b>

                            H' <b>which was promised when their sins should be
                               taken away</b>. (See Romans 11. 25, 26, & 27 and
                               also Jeremiah 31. 31, 32, & 33,)

                        G' This covenant has never been established with the
                           house of Isreal nor with the house of Judah for <b>it
                           requires two parties to make a covenant</b> and those
                           two parties must be agreed or no covenant can be
                           made.

                    F' Christ in the days of his flesh <b>proposed to make a
                       covenant with them</b>

                E' but <b>they rejected him</b> and his proposals and in
                   consequence thereof they were broken off and no covenant
                   was made with them at that time

            D' but <b>their unbelief has not rendered the promise of God of none
               effect</b>;

        C' no, for there was another day limited in David <b>which was the day of
         his power</b> and then his people Isreal, should be a willing people

    B' and he would <b>write his laws in their hearts and print them in their
       thoughts</b> their sins

A' and their eniquities <b>he would remember no more</b>,


A Thus after this chosen family had <b>rejected Christ</b> and his proposals

    B the heralds of salvation said to them “lo we turn unto the gentiles,”
      <b>and the gentiles received the covenant</b>

        C and were grafted in from whence <b>the chosen family were broken off</b>

            D but the Gentiles have <b>not continued in the goodness of God</b>

                E but have <b>departed from the faith</b>

                    F that was <b>once delivered</b> to the saints 

                    F' and <b>have broken</b> the everlasting covenant

                E' <b>in which their fathers were established</b> (see Isaiah 24th 5th) 

            D' and have <b>become high minded and have not feared</b> therefore

        C' but few of them will be <b>gathered with the chosen family</b>

    B Has not the pride highmindedness and <b>unbelief of the Gentiles</b>

A' <b>provoked the holy one of Israel to withdraw his holy spirit</b> from them and
send forth his Judgments to scourge them for their wickedness; 

this is certianly the case, Christ said to his deciples Mark 16, 17 & 18 that

        these signs should follow them that believe;
        In my name shall they cast out Devils 
        they shall speak with new tongues
        they shall take up serpants
        and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
        they shall lay hands on the sick
        and they shall recover,

        [Exact quotation of Mark 16:17--18 except missing the leading "And"]

and also in connection with this read 1 Corinthians 12 Chapt,


A By the foregoing <b>testamonies</b> or through the glass of the foregoing testamonies

    B we may <b>look at the Christian world</b>

        C and see the <b>apostacy</b> there has been

        C' from [p. 15] the <b>Apostolic platform</b>,

    B' and who can <b>look at this</b>,

A' and and not exclaim in the language of <b>Isaiah</b>,

    [“]the earth is defiled under the inhabitants thereof
    because they have
        transgressed the Laws,
        changed the ordinances
        and broken the everlasting covenant”

    [Isaiah 24:5 The earth <b>also</b> is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;
    because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance[s], broken
    the everlasting covenant.]


A The <b>plain fact</b> is this,

    B the <b>power of God</b>

        C begins to <b>fall upon the Nations</b>,

            D and the <b>light of the latter day glory</b>

                E begins to break forth <b>through the dark atmosphere</b> of
                  sectarian wickedness

                    F and their iniquity rools <b>[rolls] up into view</b>

                    F' and the Nations of the Gentiles are <b>like the waves of
                       the sea</b>

                E' <b>casting up mire and dirt</b> or all in commotion

            D' and they hastily are preparing to <b>act the part allotted them</b>

        C' when the Lord <b>rebukes the nations</b>,

    B' when <b>he shall rule them</b> with a rod of iron & break them in peaces

A' like <b>a potters vessel</b>,


A The Lord has declared to his servants some Eighteen months since

    B that he was then withdrawing his spirit from the earth,

        C and we can see that such is the fact for not only the churches a
          dwindling away,

            D but there are no conversions,

            D' or but very few, 

        C and this is not all, the governments of the earth are thrown into
          confusion & division, and distruction 

    B' to the eye of the spiritual beholder seemes to be writen 

A' by the finger of an invisable hand in Large capitals upon almost evry thing
   we behold——


A And now what remains to be done <b>under circumstan[c]es like these</b>,

    B' I will proce[e]d to tell you <b>what the Lord requires of all people</b>

        C high and low,

            D rich and poor,

            D' male and female,

        C' ministers & people professors of religion, and nonproffessors

    B' in order <b>that they may enjoy the holy spirit of God</b> to a fulness,

A' and escape <b>the Judgments of God which are almost ready to burst upon the
   nations of the earth</b>—


A Repent of all your sins

    B and be baptized in water for the remission of them,

      in the name of the father,
      and of the son,
      and of the Holy Ghost,

        C and <b>receive the ordinance</b> of the laying on of the hands

        C' of him <b>who is ordained</b>

    B' and sealed unto this power,

A' that ye may receive the holy spirit of God,


A and this according to <b>the holy scriptures</b>,

    B and of <b>the Book of Mormon</b>;

        C and [p. 16] the only way that man can enter into the Celestial kingdom.

    B' These are the requesitions of <b>the new Covenant</b>

A' or first principles of of <b>the Gospel of Christ</b>;

    then add to you[r] faith virtue
    and to virtue knowledge
    and to knowledge temperance,
    and to temperance patience,
    and to patience,
    brotherly kindness
    and to brotherly kindness
    charity (or Love) 
    and if these things be in you and abound,
    they make you to be neither baran
    nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ——
