[rough draft]

Modern members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints often use Korihor, a skeptical anti-Christ presented in Alma chapter 30 of the Book of Mormon, as a stand-in for the modern secular/scientific position (show examples).  I will demonstrate below that Korihor poorly represents the modern secular/scientific position (hereafter referred to as the naturalist position) and that counter-arguments to Korihor's ill-formed position are far less effective against the naturalist position.

his position (or aspects of it) and in other places I will point out how indefensible it is.  This document will demonstrate that the *measured skeptical* position (which is inadequately expressed by Korihor) is most likely to be accurate across time and hence can be used to serve truth and goodness far better than either Korihor's position or the position espoused by the Book of Mormon.

> 6 But it came to pass in the latter end of the seventeenth year, there came a man into the land of Zarahemla, and he was Anti-Christ, for he began to preach unto the people against the prophecies which had been spoken by the prophets, concerning the coming of Christ.

The narrator/abridger, Mormon, has the advantage here because he knows that Christ already came to the Americas (in the Book of Mormon universe).  But at the time Korihor is preaching

> 7-11 ...

> 12 And this Anti-Christ, whose name was Korihor, (and the law could have no hold upon him) began to preach unto the people that there should be no Christ. And after this manner did he preach, saying:

At least as summarized by Mormon, Korihor begins with an indefensible position: "that there should be no Christ".  How can he even assert such a thing?  A far superior stance would be: "others have asserted that Christ will come; I am open to evidence that would support such a claim, but I currently do not see enough evidence to support the claim."

> 13 O ye that are bound down under a foolish and a vain hope, why do ye yoke yourselves with such foolish things? Why do ye look for a Christ? For no man can know of anything which is to come.

Here again, Korihor is making all kinds of positive knowledge assertions for which he seems to have little or any evidence.  What evidence does Korihor have that "no man can know of anything which is to come?"  A superior stance might be: "What is the evidence that people can predict events hundreds of years into the future?  Based on how the world seems to work, that does not seem possible.  Those who make this assertion should defend it, or we are justified in tentatively dismissing it until further evidence surfaces."

> 14 Behold, these things which ye call prophecies, which ye say are handed down by holy prophets, behold, they are foolish traditions of your fathers.

> 15 How do ye know of their surety? Behold, ye cannot know of things which ye do not see; therefore ye cannot know that there shall be a Christ.

Korihor's key argument seems to be "ye cannot know of things which ye do not see".  This is another strong assertion and doesn't represent very well all the ways in which we gain confidence in assertions which are not visible to our eyes.  We often depend on testimony of others and the output of instrumentation to extend the reach of our 5 senses.

> 16 Ye look forward and say that ye see a remission of your sins. But behold, it is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.

More strong assertions which seem indefensible.  I might say, "you look forward to a remission of your sins based on your reading of your religious texts and certain mystical/spiritual experiences [more...]"

But something like receiving "a remission of sins" through the future sacrifice of Jesus seems like an unfalsifiable proposition.  Imagine, for the sake of argument, that Jesus did not properly complete the atonement and so no sins are *actually* being remitted by Jesus.  How would you know if that were the case?

> 17 [A] And many more such things did he say unto them, telling them that there could be no atonement made for the sins of men,

Again, Korihor is stating things that he cannot really know.  A better way to argue this would simply be to say that as wonderful as an atonement might sound, the idea that such an event actually occured (i.e., that a being really paid the debt of sin for all human kind that will repent) and it is effectual in any objective manner (the *idea* of an atonement my be a powerful force in someone's life simply because they believe it is powerful) is not yet substantiated.

>  17 [B] ... but every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, ...

It goes without saying that the choices we make influence how we fare.  Still, we all know that circumstances *beyond* our control can sometimes influence our life for ill.

> 17 [C] ... and that every man conquered according to his strength;  ...

Just because a person may be able to "conquer" others does not mean they *ought* to conquer others.  Once we acknowledge that other humans are conscious and that our actions impact one anothers' experiences, we have good reason treat one another with respect.  And Korihor seems to be unaware that his same logic could also have been just as easily directed in different, less toxic directions.  For instance, he could have said "every man *serves his fellow man* according to his strength" and this would have been just as valid a statement based on his, admittedly poor, logic.

> 17 [D] ... and whatsoever a man did was no crime.

A small minority of atheists have argued this position (moral nihilism), but it seems unsupportable to most modern secular humanists.  Are we really to believe that torturing young children--for fun--is not wrong?  The recognition that other humans have conscious experiences compels rational beings to treat others with kindness and respect.

> 18 And thus he did preach unto them, leading away the hearts of many, causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness, yea, leading away many women, and also men, to commit whoredoms—telling them that when a man was dead, that was the end thereof.

We need to distinguish between two possible types of "wickedness".  The first type genuinely inflicts harm on another person *for* personal pleasure or *enroute* to some personal pleasure.  These are genuine moral harms.  Regardless of one's belief in life after death, we have extremely high confidence that our actions impact the well-being of others, hence acting in ways that harm the well-being of others without good justification is morally wrong.  We do not need an after-life to convince us of that fact.  The second type of "wickedness" might be to act in contravention of some religious rule that has no real grounding in, or even inflicts, moral harm.  For instance, the religious law of the Nephites, as the Book of Mormon goes, was the Law of Moses which included cutting off the protective part of the genitalia of their sons at eight days old (Leviticus 12:3).  To refuse to circumcise one's child might be called "wickedness" by people raised under the Law of Moses, even if not circumcising one's children is arguably a morally acceptable behavior.

But the verse also talks about "whoredoms".  Narrowly speaking, this would refer to prostitution or similar kinds of activity.  The moral implications of sexuality are complex.  Certain kinds of sexual expression seem clearly to diminish the well-being of one or more participants, so we can clearly say these are morally problematic or, in many cases, clearly and distinctly wrong.

> 19 Now this man went over to the land of Jershon also, to preach these things among the people of Ammon, who were once the people of the Lamanites.

> 20 But behold they were more wise than many of the Nephites; for they took him, and bound him, and carried him before Ammon, who was a high priest over that people.

Why is the wise approach to simply refuse to engage with Korihor?  If his positions are unsound, then it should be trivial to demonstrate them unsound.  If his arguments are sound, then perhaps these people have something to learn.  Refusing to listen to another position and instead binding a person and taking them to your religious leader [Ammon wasn't a civil leader, right?] for judgement seems like a poor response to differing views.  

> 21 And it came to pass that he caused that he should be carried out of the land.

Again, kicking someone out of your territory because you disagree with their position seems highly intolerant.  How do Latter-day Saints view the countries that don't allow their missionaries in to teach?  Are these countries wise for refusing to even listen to a counter point of view?

> ... And he came over into the land of Gideon, and began to preach unto them also; and here he did not have much success, for he was taken and bound and carried before the high priest, and also the chief judge over the land.

Again, why is binding a person and taking them to the religious leader the natural response to someone preaching something contrary to one's belief?

> 22 And it came to pass that the high priest said unto him: Why do ye go about perverting the ways of the Lord? Why do ye teach this people that there shall be no Christ, to interrupt their rejoicings? Why do ye speak against all the prophecies of the holy prophets?

> 23 Now the high priest’s name was Giddonah. And Korihor said unto him: Because I do not teach the foolish traditions of your fathers, and because I do not teach this people to bind themselves down under the foolish ordinances and performances which are laid down by ancient priests, ... 

Although Korihor maintains that the religious position can't be known with confidence, calling the traditions and ordinances "foolish" without specific justification seems like a useless and disrespectful ad hominem attack.

> ... to usurp power and authority over them, to keep them in ignorance, that they may not lift up their heads, but be brought down according to thy words.

How does Korihor know the motivation of these ancient priests?  Why would the priests be so intent on "bringing down" the people?  Can we simply agree that most religious people believe that the message they are sharing is making the world a better place, even if we disagree as to how well that accomplishes their intended purpose?

> 24 Ye say that this people is a free people. Behold, I say they are in bondage. ...

I don't think we have enough data to decide this accusation.  And, how we view the freedom/bondage state of the people is conditioned somewhat on whether their worldview is veridical.

> Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true. Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.

The main flaw in interpreting this statement is that it was, according to the book itself, abridged by someone living hundreds of years later.  With the benefit of hindsight, it is difficult to criticize those who believe that "those ancient prophecies are true."  So, given the narrator's advantage, it seems as if Korihor is short-sighted and those who believe in the ancient prophecies are prescient.

However, the naturalists question whether anyone *has* ever predicted the future via supernatural means (we *can* devise [tests for prophetic ability](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/ckc6ef/the_garden_of_eden_and_noahs_ark_has_been_found/evs2nca/)).  Scripture is full of examples of abusing the original meaning of a scripture to turn it into a fulfillment event or prophecies that are so vague that we can say that almost any event fulfills them.

So, pushing back on those who believe in prophecy seems fair.

> 25 Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a parent. Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.

This is a fair argument from Korihor.  There are very good reasons to doubt the existence of a literal Adam and Eve.  If they never lived, it is difficult to think there was a literal Fall.  It then follows that talk about inheriting anything (a fallen nature or death) from the fall is problematic.  Humans were dying before Adam (a man that never existed in the role attributed to him by scripture).  Humans were "sinning" (may not have called it that) before Adam (again, a man that never existed in the role attributed to him by scripture).

> 26 And ye also say that Christ shall come. But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a Christ. And ye say also that he shall be slain for the sins of the world—

See commentary on verse 24.

> 27 And thus ye lead away this people after the foolish traditions of your fathers, and according to your own desires; and ye keep them down, even as it were in bondage, that ye may glut yourselves with the labors of their hands, that they durst not look up with boldness, and that they durst not enjoy their rights and privileges.

Korihor is attributing all kinds of motivation to the priests that they would not attribute to themselves.  That makes him guilty of motivational misattribution and those describing him in this fashion guilty of constructing a straw-man.  We can disagree with the epistemological soundness of a priest's position without doubting his sincerity or altruism.

And, his choice of the word "foolish" is far less generous and precise than words like "unsubstantiated" and/or "unsubstantiatable" to describe the religious position.  Again, we sense the construction of a straw-man--the generous skeptic has no reason to use harsh rhetoric in describing the religious position.  We can disagree without being disagreeable.

> 28 [A] Yea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest they should offend their priests, who do yoke them according to their desires,

See commentary on verse 27.

> 28 [B] ... and have brought them to believe, by their traditions and their dreams and their whims and their visions and their pretended mysteries, that they should, if they did not do according to their words, offend some unknown being, who they say is God—a being who never has been seen or known, who never was nor ever will be.

Korihor's position is a naive straw-man because he is asserting that the priests are "pretending" on some level.  But mystical/spiritual experience is a well-documented part of the human experience.  The naturalist position simply asserts that spiritual experiences are, one way or the other, the product of a person's own mental faculties

> 28 [C] ... that they should, if they did not do according to their words, offend some unknown being, who they say is God—a being who never has been seen or known, who never was nor ever will be.

But many people have had entheogenic experiences.  Korihor is too confident--we can't fully rule out the existence of God.  But, we can assert that there are good reasons to doubt that these experiences are the result of communication with an omniscient being.  Rather, they likely represent mental constructs of the divine.

> 29 Now when the high priest and the chief judge saw the hardness of his heart, yea, when they saw that he would revile even against God, they would not make any reply to his words; but they caused that he should be bound; and they delivered him up into the hands of the officers, and sent him to the land of Zarahemla, that he might be brought before Alma, and the chief judge who was governor over all the land.

> 30 And it came to pass that when he was brought before Alma and the chief judge, he did go on in the same manner as he did in the land of Gideon; yea, he went on to blaspheme.

> 31 And he did rise up in great swelling words before Alma, and did revile against the priests and teachers, accusing them of leading away the people after the silly traditions of their fathers, for the sake of glutting on the labors of the people.

> 32 Now Alma said unto him: Thou knowest that we do not glut ourselves upon the labors of this people; for behold I have labored even from the commencement of the reign of the judges until now, with mine own hands for my support, notwithstanding my many travels round about the land to declare the word of God unto my people.

> 33 And notwithstanding the many labors which I have performed in the church, I have never received so much as even one senine for my labor; neither has any of my brethren, save it were in the judgment-seat; and then we have received only according to law for our time.

> 34 And now, if we do not receive anything for our labors in the church, what doth it profit us to labor in the church save it were to declare the truth, that we may have rejoicings in the joy of our brethren?

> 35 Then why sayest thou that we preach unto this people to get gain, when thou, of thyself, knowest that we receive no gain? And now, believest thou that we deceive this people, that causes such joy in their hearts?

> 36 And Korihor answered him, Yea.

> 37 And then Alma said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?

> 38 And he answered, Nay.

> 39 Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny again that there is a God, and also deny the Christ? For behold, I say unto you, I know there is a God, and also that Christ shall come.

> 40 And now what evidence have ye that there is no God, or that Christ cometh not? I say unto you that ye have none, save it be your word only.

> 41 But, behold, I have all things as a testimony that these things are true; and ye also have all things as a testimony unto you that they are true; and will ye deny them? Believest thou that these things are true?

> 42 Behold, I know that thou believest, but thou art possessed with a lying spirit, and ye have put off the Spirit of God that it may have no place in you; but the devil has power over you, and he doth carry you about, working devices that he may destroy the children of God.

> 43 And now Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt show me a sign, that I may be convinced that there is a God, yea, show unto me that he hath power, and then will I be convinced of the truth of thy words.

> 44 But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.

> 45 And yet do ye go about, leading away the hearts of this people, testifying unto them there is no God? And yet will ye deny against all these witnesses? And he said: Yea, I will deny, except ye shall show me a sign.

> 46 And now it came to pass that Alma said unto him: Behold, I am grieved because of the hardness of your heart, yea, that ye will still resist the spirit of the truth, that thy soul may be destroyed.

> 47 But behold, it is better that thy soul should be lost than that thou shouldst be the means of bringing many souls down to destruction, by thy lying and by thy flattering words; therefore if thou shalt deny again, behold God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.

> 48 Now Korihor said unto him: I do not deny the existence of a God, but I do not believe that there is a God; and I say also, that ye do not know that there is a God; and except ye show me a sign, I will not believe.

> 49 Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto thee for a sign, that thou shalt be struck dumb, according to my words; and I say, that in the name of God, ye shall be struck dumb, that ye shall no more have utterance.

> 50 Now when Alma had said these words, Korihor was struck dumb, that he could not have utterance, according to the words of Alma.

> 51 And now when the chief judge saw this, he put forth his hand and wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou convinced of the power of God? In whom did ye desire that Alma should show forth his sign? Would ye that he should afflict others, to show unto thee a sign? Behold, he has showed unto you a sign; and now will ye dispute more?

> 52 And Korihor put forth his hand and wrote, saying: I know that I am dumb, for I cannot speak; and I know that nothing save it were the power of God could bring this upon me; yea, and I always knew that there was a God.

> 53 But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in the form of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone astray after an unknown God. And he said unto me: There is no God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say. And I have taught his words; and I taught them because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I taught them, even until I had much success, insomuch that I verily believed that they were true; and for this cause I withstood the truth, even until I have brought this great curse upon me.

> 54 Now when he had said this, he besought that Alma should pray unto God, that the curse might be taken from him.

> 55 But Alma said unto him: If this curse should be taken from thee thou wouldst again lead away the hearts of this people; therefore, it shall be unto thee even as the Lord will.

> 56 And it came to pass that the curse was not taken off of Korihor; but he was cast out, and went about from house to house begging for his food.

> 57 Now the knowledge of what had happened unto Korihor was immediately published throughout all the land; yea, the proclamation was sent forth by the chief judge to all the people in the land, declaring unto those who had believed in the words of Korihor that they must speedily repent, lest the same judgments would come unto them.

> 58 And it came to pass that they were all convinced of the wickedness of Korihor; therefore they were all converted again unto the Lord; and this put an end to the iniquity after the manner of Korihor. And Korihor did go about from house to house, begging food for his support.

> 59 And it came to pass that as he went forth among the people, yea, among a people who had separated themselves from the Nephites and called themselves Zoramites, being led by a man whose name was Zoram—and as he went forth amongst them, behold, he was run upon and trodden down, even until he was dead.

> 60 And thus we see the end of him who perverteth the ways of the Lord; and thus we see that the devil will not support his children at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to hell.


## Korihor as caricature

1. Repeatedly makes strong, unfounded assertions without justification.
1. Ridicules religious positions which seem unfalsifiable (and hence are outside his ability to falsify).
1. Supports end-justifies-the means aggression
1. Seems to condone unrestrained and morally problematic sexuality
1. Appears to lie or mislead about priests earning wages
1. Claims that the priests are intentionally deceiving the people, when it seems clear from the narrative that they geniunely believe in their position.
1. Is a hypocrite of highest-order: he knows from direct experience that supernatural entities, like angels (or in this case the devil disguised as an angel) exist which seems to undermine his insistence that God is not real and nobody can know of those kinds of things.
1. Is gullible and selfish enough that he is willing to advance what seems like an incoherent belief system (no God, delievered to him by an angel).
1. Exemplifies the New Testament trope of being adulterous (encouraging whoredoms and succumbing to the allure of the carnal man), and then disingenuously seeking for a sign.
