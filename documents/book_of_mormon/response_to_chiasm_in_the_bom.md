Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon is often given as evidence of the ancient origin of the book.  However, the argument may not be as strong as believing members sometimes make it out to be.

1. Chiastic structure was fully described in a popular Bible commentary of the day.

    Joseph Smith was very familiar with Clarke's commentary on the bible---we know that he [borrowed liberally from the commentary in his JST](http://jur.byu.edu/?p=21296).  We also know that work on the JST began less than 2 years after the publication of the BoM.
    
    The commentary [clearly _describes_ chiasmus](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/81ysu1/chiasmus_proof_of_antiquity_or_red_herring/), even though it does not name it as such.

2. Chiasmus may occur by chance, and we may easily demonstrate it in many forms of communication---particularly if we are willing to cherry-pick our themes.

    * The BoM chiasms are not nearly as perfect as believing members make them out to be.  For instance, it can easily be shown that [Alma 36 has been cherry-picked](https://dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V38N04_105.pdf) in order to generate the chiastic structure often touted as a pinnacle literary achievement.
    * It is relatively easy to demonstrate latent chiastic structure in various forms of communication, [such as a string of reddit comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/65k95j/im_glad_that_fairmormon_exists_the_fairmormon/dh3lad0/) (related to #2).
    * Chiasmus may easily occur by chance.  Consider, for instance, [the chiastic structure of Green Eggs and Ham](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V33N04_173.pdf).
