### Introduction

In support of the idea that the doctrines contained in the Book of Mormon must have been from a divine source because they were not taught in Joseph Smith's contemporary Christianity, [Tad Callister argued](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/tad-r-callister_book-mormon-man-made-god-given/):

> ... contrary to contemporary beliefs, the Book of Mormon refers to a premortal existence in Alma 13 (see Alma 13:1–11)

An analysis of the pre-1830's literature convincingly demonstrates that many Christians were teaching the idea of a premortal existence.

### The Evidence

Terryl Givens recently wrote a book on the topic of the premortal existence in various thought across time (When Souls Had Wings).  He [recently commented](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705380211/Terryl-Givens-Pre-mortal-existence-not-a-new-concept.html?pg=all):

> The LDS faith is the only significant Christian denomination teaching this doctrine today.  But it turns out, **literally dozens—perhaps hundreds—of poets, mystics, philosophers, theologians and pastors have taught this same principle across the centuries**. (emphasis added)

And, importantly, Givens indicated that Joseph Smith was likely exposed to these ideas.

> One should not assume that because I am LDS, I must be writing with the intention of mustering arguments on behalf of an LDS theology. If that were indeed the case, I would have failed entirely. For in the entire history of the idea of a premortal soul, virtually no version matches Joseph Smith’s conception or shows evidence of having influenced his own.

Elsewhere, Givens notes that the brand of pre-mortal existence Joseph Smith
taught was idosyncratic.  Still, the Book of Mormon does not fully represent
the most fully idiosyncratic version.



### New Testament allusions

The author of Alma 13 [repeatedly alludes to teachings and phrases from the New Testament](https://www.bookofmormonorigins.com/content/alma/chapter_13.html) rather than the Old Testament.  This aligns more closely with a modern author rather than an author writing before the creation of the New Testament.
