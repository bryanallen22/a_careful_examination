## Introduction

The first two examples below were shared by Bill Davis on December 20 and 21 of 2021.

Bill discussed the Alma 10:51 example in some depth.

> Amulek: "I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power. I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake, for I have seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power"

> Did you catch that?  The switch from Amulek saying "I never had known" to saying "I mistake, for I have seen."

> It's not a honing or restatement of meaning, but rather a complete reversal from the first claim to the second claim.

> That's what happens when the mouth is running faster than the mind (we all have that problem now and again, right?).

> But this is important to note: This isn't the type of mistake that a person makes who is engraving words on a metal plate.  It's a lot of extra and unnecessary words, and a lot of extra work.

> This also isn't the type of mistake that a person leaves in a text, when revising the draft of a work.  In other words, it's not "refined" (mechanically or, for that matter, stylistically). 

> This is, however, the type of mistake and immediate self-correction and oral revision that occurs in spoken (dictated) scenarios. 

> What this tells us:  When Joseph Smith dictated the Book of Mormon, he was involved in the process as an active contributor to the language of the text.

## Alma 10:51 "I mistake"

*Amulek*: “...I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power. 

*[pause; recognition that a mistake was made]*

I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I **mistake**, for I ***have*** seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power ...”

## Alma 52:6 "truly he was preparing"

But he [Teancum] kept his men round about, ***as if*** making preparations for war [pretending];

*[pause; decision to revise]*

yea, and ***truly he was*** preparing [not pretending] to defend himself against
them, by casting up walls round about and preparing places of resort.

## Alma 24:19 "buried their weapons of peace"[^couch]

... and thus we see that they buried their ***weapons of peace***,

*[revise]*

or they buried ***the weapons of war, for peace***.

[^couch]: Mentioned by Ashely Couch in a commenton Bill's December 21st post.
