#### Some Evidence for Pre-Columbian Horses exists

Steven E. Jones has compiled a list of horse bones and data [which suggest the existence of some pre-Columbian horses](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303446285_Were_there_Horses_in_the_Americas_before_Columbus).

There is some evidence of later horse fossils (~2540 YBP) from Wade Miller.  These dates have been published in BYU Studies, but they have not been published in a scientific journal yet (see https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/8dovks/an_attempt_to_account_for_the_use_of_horse_in_the/dxoyvsk/).  I'm not sure if the authors will publish these findings to a scientific journal--obviously, if the scientific community is meant to accept them then they will require scientific peer review.

The bibliography at the bottom of this article points to all the relevant apologetic data on the topic of which I am aware: https://bookofmormoncentral.org/qa/why-does-the-book-of-mormon-mention-horses

#### Absence of Cultural Integration

Even if we grant that wild horses were around a given culture, the use of horses and chariots (or large wheeled vehicles of any kind) in the manner implied by Alma 18 is undocumented among any pre-Columbian Americans.  The fallback apologetic model is that the chariot was more of a human-powered litter and the horses merely accompanied the kingly procession in order to provide food for the journey (there is some support for this in the text).  Still, we expect that such a program of domestication (for food or otherwise) would have left marks in a culture's iconography and dramatically increased the odds that horse remains would be associated with archaeological digs (see, for instance, https://www.sapiens.org/column/off-the-map/horse-domestication-mongolia/ compared with http://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/mesoamericans-teotihuacan-kept-ferocious-animals-captive-and-may-have-fed-020668). As it stands, there is no record of horses being domesticated for food by any pre-Columbian American culture of which I am aware.

Word "loan-shifting" has also been suggested as a way of dealing with the horse problem (so, perhaps "horse" meant tapir, elk, or deer).  The difficulty here is that tapir, elk, and deer are not domesticable, so it is difficult to imagine any of these being used as described in the fallback model for Alma 18.  In addition, we have no evidence that these animals were used in that fashion among any pre-Columbian American culture.  Of course, the archaeological record is not comprehensive, so absence of evidence is not conclusive evidence of absence in this domain.

#### Joseph Smith's milieu?

The prevailing thought in Joseph Smith's time was that horses were brought to the Americas by the Europeans.  However, the popular book "The Natural and Aboriginal History of Tennessee" published in 1823 mentions ancient horse fossils (this was before carbon dating, so they didn't know how old, but they assumed pre-Columbian).  So, it is not unreasonable for an early 1800s mind to have assumed that the ancient Americans had horses.
