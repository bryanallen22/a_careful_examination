Dan McClellan, the [Scripture Translation Supervisor for the LDS Church](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielomcclellan/), commented on how to better understand the Book of Mormon ([#387, How to better understand the Book of Mormon, posted 2021-12-22](https://www.tiktok.com/@maklelan/video/7044681223708658990)):

> Hey everybody, I have been asked recently to talk more about the Book of
> Mormon, so I want to share the piece of advice that I usually give when
> people ask me how to better understand it. If you want to understand the
> Book of Mormon better, you should approach it as a piece of 19th-century
> literature. This is not to say anything about its origins or to say you
> cannot maintain a conviction that it is an English translation of an ancient
> source text. It is to say, whatever its origins it is written in 19th
> century English for a 19th century target audience. This is made clear by a
> number of literary and linguistic conventions that are native to that time
> period. So, the better you can understand the literary, rhetorical,
> ideological, historical contexts of that time period---get your 1828
> Webster's out, read some of the other literature from that time period---the
> better you can do that the better you will come to understanding.
