## Introduction

In a recent interview while Stephen Smoot was defending a historical Book of Mormon and its divine translation, he also [conceded that King James Version translation errors appear in the Book of Mormon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvuMW63-OM&t=3371s) (emphasis added):

> ...and so I think **all parties can agree that there are King James citations and errors**, but the question is what kind of a translation is it ...

Smoot then quotes Joseph Smith from [D&C 128](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128?lang=eng&id=17,18#17,18) to provide context for understanding _why_ such errors might exist, essentially that while he might "have rendered a plainer translation ... it is sufficiently plain to suit [his] purpose."
