An interesting apologetic argument for Zenos [documented at Book of Mormon central](https://knowhy.bookofmormoncentral.org/content/is-anything-known-of-the-prophet-zenos-outside-of-the-book-of-mormon).

A few notes in counter:

Primarily, there are [a substantial numbers of modern sources which can explain the allegory]({{ "/potential-sources-allegory-olive-tree/" | relative_url }}).

There is not a great correspondence between the Zenos of the BoM and Cenez:
> However, after careful analysis, Welch concluded that a direct identification between Cenez and Zenos is not likely.

> What is more probable is that there was an earlier ancient source than the surviving story of Cenez which inspired the vineyard imagery found in the Book of Mormon.

* Zenos and Zenoch sound very similar to Enos and Enoch, the latter two which are both biblical names (from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/25ekuo/zenos_zenoch_and_neum/))
* [Zeno](https://www.google.com/search?q=zeno&lr=lang_en&biw=1073&bih=921&source=lnt&tbs=lr%3Alang_1en%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F1750%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F1829&tbm=bks) (and [zenos in plural or possessive form](https://www.google.com/search?lr=lang_en&biw=839&bih=777&tbs=lr%3Alang_1en%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F1750%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F1829&tbm=bks&ei=nIaVW-rML4aTzwLjprOgAw&q=zenos&oq=zenos&gs_l=psy-ab.3...67221.67221.0.67332.1.1.0.0.0.0.110.110.0j1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.sQjhChWe_P0)) was used somewhat commonly in the early 1800s literature.
* The Greek meaning of "Zeno" is derived from the greek God Zeus, which seems odd for an Israelite prophet of that time. (oddity [noted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/25ekuo/zenos_zenoch_and_neum/))
