Of the 8 verses from the Book of Mormon that contain possible or likely [KJV translation errors]({{ "/scholar-survey-kjv-translation-errors-in-bom-isaiah/" | relative_url }}) all of these "errors" seem to be preserved in the 1611 King James Version.

In general, the Book of Mormon appears to rely exclusively on the 1769 King James translation (compared with the 1611 King James Version or other derivatives) in *other* instances where the two texts diverge.

For instance, compare Isaiah 49:13 (and 1 Nephi 21:13):

* 1611 - Sing, O heauen, and be ioyfull, O earth, and breake forth into singing, O mountaines: for **God** hath comforted his people, and will haue mercy vpon his afflicted.
* 1769 - Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for **the LORD** hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.
* BofM - Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; for the feet of those who are in the east shall be established; and break forth into singing, O mountains; for they shall be smitten no more; for **the Lord** hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.

Also, the Book of Mormon appears **not** to have been directly influenced by the 1611 KJV syntax, as reported in Royal Skousen and Stanford Carmack's latest BYU Studies article (2018, from a pre-print copy):

> ... Stanford Carmack has found that the Book of Mormon syntax matches best what we find in English from the second half of the 1500s, but **it does not match the syntax of the 1611 King James Bible** ... (emphasis added)

Finally, in matters of style and spelling, it seems clear that the Book of Mormon generally followed after the 1769 KJV but not the 1611 version.
