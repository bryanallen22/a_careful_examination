### Could Joseph have hidden material in his hat to draw upon during the dictation process?

This model depends upon at least 6 elements in order to be viable.  If any one of these were found to not be viable, the model would be confidently falsified.  If all of these 6 elements can be shown viable, then the model as a whole may also be considered viable.

1. Observers and scribes would need to be discouraged from examining the hat too closely both while Joseph was translating and if he merely left the hat on the table in order to leave the room (otherwise they might observe the material Joseph was using).

    Cowdery quote.

2. The hat would need to be deep enough to hide a manuscript from casual observation.

    Pat Chiu apparently [determined that Joseph owned a beaver-skin hat with a "top hat" profile](https://www.millennialstar.org/the-beaver-skin-hat-how-joseph-interpreted-the-plates/).  These hats are typically [fairly deep](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/b2c80f8321fe53ef44e9f98c29a886d6634781ff/documents/book_of_mormon/translation/hats_1815-1840.jpg)---deep enough that a casual observer from the side would not be able to detect a paper fragment in the bottom.

3. The hat would need to be wide enough to hold roughly a half-day's worth of dictation material.

    * Pat Chiu apparently [determined that Joseph owned a beaver-skin hat with a "top hat" profile](https://www.millennialstar.org/the-beaver-skin-hat-how-joseph-interpreted-the-plates/).
    * Abraham Lincoln kept important letters inside his stovepipe hat,(Benjamin P. Thomas (26 September 2008). Abraham Lincoln: A Biography. SIU Press. pp. 39. ISBN 978-0-8093-2887-1) which is roughly the same size as the kind of top hat Joseph was likely to have worn (compare [romantic era hats](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/b2c80f8321fe53ef44e9f98c29a886d6634781ff/documents/book_of_mormon/translation/hats_1815-1840.jpg) with [Lincoln's hat](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/b2c80f8321fe53ef44e9f98c29a886d6634781ff/documents/book_of_mormon/translation/hats_1840-1870.jpg))

    * 93.5 square inches on a sheet of letter paper
    * A hat 6 to 8 inches in diameter would have yielded between 28 and 50 square inches, or between 1/3 to 1/2 the area of a standard sheet of paper.
    * 531 pages in the BoM and [273,725 words](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/60afwe/book_of_mormon_word_count/), so about 515.5 words per page.
    * Assume 80 working days, with two sessions per day (each session would have provided him the opportunity to swap out material, as explained below.  This means that 3.3 pages, or 1700 words, needed to be dictated per session.
    * A single hat-sized fragment could have held somewhere between [between 100 and 150 words](https://www.quora.com/How-many-handwritten-words-fit-on-an-adage-8-5x11-page).
    * There are 6604 verses in the Book of Mormon and about 41.4 words per verse.  1700 words / 41 words/verse = 41 verses per session.
    * Assuming the above, he had space on his manuscript for roughly 1 to 2 English written words per verse.

    This corresponds roughly to the compression ratio we see between individual characters and the associated verbiage found in the Book of Abraham in [the Grammar and Alphabet of the Egyptian Language](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/grammar-and-alphabet-of-the-egyptian-language-circa-july-circa-november-1835/10).  On average, we see very roughly 40 words associated with each Egyptian character.  (And please consider Vogel's arguments demonstrating that [the GAEL indeed represents the dictation event of the Book of Abraham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtJT_xjIgdM) contrary to what some LDS scholars have argued.)

    In other words, under the naturalist model, Joseph Smith was _clearly capable_ of embellishing scripture associated with representations that could have easily been contained on a fragment that would have fit neatly inside his hat.

    I think that would have been non-trivial to do with Isaiah, but remember that only a subset of the Isaiah verses are word for word.  In addition, Joseph would only need to request higher frequency of dictation sessions in order to increase the hat-manuscript to BoM-original-handwritten-manuscript ratio.

    Finally, the Quran has about the same number of verses in it as the Book of Mormon and [the Quran can be memorized in between 8 months to 1.5 years](https://www.quora.com/How-much-time-does-it-take-an-average-to-memorize-the-Quran).  So, given that the dictation process was spread out over time, it is also seems possible that Joseph could commit verses to short term memory (or become very familiar with them) between dictation sessions (particularly if aided by a fragment).

4. Joseph would need time to decipher what was on the manuscript and/or extrapolate/embellish some of the material.

    Joseph needed to dictate about 41 verses per 4 hour working period (assuming a session were 4 hours).  This seems a very reasonable rate to allow for reflection, recall, and embellishment.

5. Material would need to be swapped into and out of the hat at least once or twice daily.

    Joseph [carried a stone on his person](https://bycommonconsent.com/2006/02/02/seer-stone-lessons/), which means that he had a reason to reach into his hat at the beginning of each session to deposit the stone and at the end of each session to retrieve the stone.  During this action, a fragment could have been deposited and then retrieved along with the rock.  Perhaps the fragment was merely placed inside Smith's shirt/jacket sleeve (similar to the card in sleeve trick).

6. Light would need to be able to enter the hat sporadically in order for Joseph to be able to view the material on the manuscript.

    * Presumably, Joseph would pull his head away from the hat in order to dictate the words---it is difficult to imagine that his speech would be clear enough were he to dictate _into_ the hat.  So, each verbal communication afforded a chance for light to enter the hat and for him to gaze down into the hat before sealing his face to it.
    * It is very difficult to perfectly seal one's face to the mouth of a circular hat (try it!).  By simply tilting his head slightly, he could catch streams of light coming from almost any angle.
    * Most of the top hats of the era had ribbons running around them.  Perhaps a slit or two could have been prepared below the ribbon.  Then, when translation was to proceed, the ribbon could be slid slightly down while fingers could simultaneously obscure the slit from observers.  The slit could allow in light.
    * The seams around the top of the hat (so the bottom of the hat during translation) may have been somewhat loose.  The rock could have helped to open the seams to allow in some light.

    Further work is needed in order to determine if any of the methods discussed above are actually viable with parchment inside a beaver-skin top hat.  In a cursory experiment with my gardening hat, it was easy to get enough light in to make out small words on printed text.
