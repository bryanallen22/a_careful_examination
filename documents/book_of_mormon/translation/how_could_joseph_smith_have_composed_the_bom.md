### The oral composition model

1. Joseph was immersed in a cultural and religious milieu that seems proportional to the contents of the Book of Mormon.
1. Joseph demonstrated significant oral compositional ability (e.g., Book of Moses, Book of Abraham, Revelations in the D&C, extensive sermons).  Since most of us were raised to organize our thoughts via writing, it is difficult to imagine others composing extensive structure primarily in their minds, but this was not an uncommon ability in that era (e.g., regularly demonstrated among preachers).
1. Even though this was not likely according to plan, the initial dictation of the lost 116 pages would have served as a warm-up period allowing Joseph significant practice in order to develop and refine his compositional abilities before dictating the text we now know as the Book of Mormon.
1. The Book of Mormon is mostly modular in its construction (i.e., it has few dependencies from section to section *generally*).  Where dependencies exist, those can be explained by him and/or Oliver going back over the existing manuscript, or perhaps simply due to his oral compositional abilities.
1. The available time to compose the book (~65 working days) is not inconsistent with some kind of oral composition event.  Also, the timeline provides room for years of rumination and planning to have preceded the final compositional event.
