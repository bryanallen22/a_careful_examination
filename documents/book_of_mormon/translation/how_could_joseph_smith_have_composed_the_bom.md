LDS apologists often point to the significant [consistency and complexity](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormonscholar/comments/8nnsr4/what_would_joseph_smith_have_to_keep_track_of_in/) found in the Book of Mormon (also see the work of [Royal Skousen](http://criticaltext.byustudies.byu.edu/biblio)) and the [short translation timeline](https://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Book_of_Mormon_Translation_By_Joseph_Smith) as [evidence for divine intervention](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/tad-r-callister_book-mormon-man-made-god-given/) in the book's creation.

John Hamer and Dan Vogel have recently articulated the reasons they support the model that Joseph Smith was solely responsible for the creation of the Book of Mormon, and these arguments are compelling.  The key components of that model are these:

1. Joseph was immersed in a [cultural](https://www.mormonstories.org/podcast/book-of-mormon-cultural-context-john-hamer/) and [religious milieu]({{ "/bom-parallels-to-1800s-thought/" | relative_url }}) that seems proportional to the contents of the Book of Mormon.
1. Joseph demonstrated significant oral compositional ability (e.g., Book of Moses, Book of Abraham, Revelations in the D&C, extensive sermons).  Since most of us were raised to organize our thoughts via writing, it is difficult to imagine others composing extensive structure primarily in their minds, but this was not an uncommon ability in that era (e.g., regularly demonstrated among preachers).
1. The Book of Mormon is mostly modular in its construction (i.e., it has few dependencies from section to section *generally*).  Where dependencies exist, those can be explained by him and/or Oliver going back over the existing manuscript, or perhaps simply due to his oral compositional abilities.
1. The available time to compose the book (~65 working days) is not inconsistent with some kind of oral composition event.  Also, the timeline provides room for years of rumination and planning to have preceded the final compositional event.

While other models exist (discussed in the introduction [here]({{ "/hidden-material-in-hat-hypothesis/" | relative_url }})), the "Joseph Smith orally composed the book" model satisfies available data constraints with the fewest assumptions.
