The problem with the seer stone is *not* that Joseph used it for the translation.  Believing members *already* accept that Moses put a snake on a stick and people were healed by looking at it.  Members already accept Jesus putting mud on people's eyes to help restore their site, etc.

The *primary* issues with the seer stone, as I see it now, are these:

1. Because Joseph found the stone digging a well and used it as part of his treasure digging activities, then it makes it much easier to view the finding and translation of the Book of Mormon as an *extension* of his treasure digging activities.  It makes it easier to view Moroni as a treasure guardian and the Book of Mormon as part of a strategy (with pious intentions or not) emanating from that perspective.

1. Do we have any documentation that Joseph ever found anything with his seer stone?  If not, then why would we expect the stone to be helpful in translating ancient documents?

1. If the primary/original function of the seer stone was to enable Joseph to find treasure, then why didn't he look into the stone to locate the 116 missing pages?  And why was Joseph so distraught with their loss if he really could simply re-translate them again with the seer stone?  The resolution of the 116 pages episode, including the explanation in Words of Mormon 1:7, seems to point away from Joseph's ability to dictate or use a seer stone and towards a modern origin.

1. The use of the seer stone calls into question the purpose of the interpreters and the plates themselves.  Here's how BYU professors Joseph Fielding McConkie and Craig Ostler [explain the problem](https://emp.byui.edu/SatterfieldB/Rel121/Process%20of%20Translating%20the%20BofM.pdf):

>  ... the testimony of David Whitmer [Joseph using the seer stone to translate, words appearing on the stone, etc] simply does not accord with the divine pattern. If Joseph Smith translated everything that is now in the Book of Mormon without using the gold plates, we are left to wonder why the plates were necessary in the first place. It will be remembered that possession of the plates placed the Smith family in considerable danger, causing them a host of difficulties. If the plates were not part of the translation process, this would not have been the case. It also leaves us wondering why the Lord directed the writers of the Book of Mormon to make a duplicate record of the plates of Lehi. This provision which compensated for the loss of the 116 pages would have served no purpose either. Further, we would be left to wonder why it was necessary for Moroni to instruct Joseph each year for four years before he was entrusted with the plates. We would also wonder why it was so important for Moroni to show the plates to the three witnesses, including David Whitmer. And why did the Lord have the Prophet show the plates to the eight witnesses? Why all this flap and fuss if the Prophet didn't really have the plates and if they were not used in the process of translation? What David Whitmer is asking us to believe is that the Lord had Moroni seal up the plates and the means by which they were to be translated hundreds of years before they would come into Joseph Smith's possession and then decided to have the Prophet use a seer stone found while digging a well so that none of these things would be necessary after all.  Is this, we would ask, really a credible explanation of the way the heavens operate?

1. Joseph Smith discusses two stones in silver bows fastened to a breastplate
   in his 1838 history (the one canonized in the Pearl of Great Price).  These
   "two stones in silver bows...fastened to a breastplate, ... [and] the
   posession and use of these stones were what constituted 'seers' in ancient
   or former times; ... [and] God had prepared them for the purpose of
   translating the book".

   Oliver Cowdery testifies to these details (quoting from Welch's [The
   Miraculous Translation of the Book of Mormon](https://archive.bookofmormoncentral.org/sites/default/files/archive-files/pdf/welch/2016-04-11/welch_the_miraculous_translation_of_the_book_of_mormon_opening_the_heavens.pdf)):

    * 1834 (to W.W. Phelps): "Day after day I continued, uninterrupted, to write from his mouth, as he translated, with the Urim and Thummim, or, as the Nephites whould have said, 'Interpreters,' the history, or record, called the â€œThe book of Mormon."
    * 1841 (to Josiah Jones): "...was found about three years ago by a man named Joseph Smith Jr. who had translated it by looking into a stone or two stones, when put into a dark place, which stones he said were found in the box with the plates. They affirmed while he looked through the stone spectacles another sat by and wrote what he told them, and thus the book was all written... He [Cowdery] stated that Smith looked into or through the transparent stones to translate what was on the plates."
    * 1848 (recorded by Reuben Miller): "I wrote with my own pen the intire book of mormon (Save a few pages) as it fell from the Lips of the prophet [Joseph Smith]. As he translated <it> by the gift and power of god, By [the] means of the urum and thummim, or as it is called by that book holy Interperters. I beheld with my eyes. And handled with my hands the gold plates from which it was translated. I also beheld the Interperters."
    * 1907 (to Samuel Whitney Richards): He [Oliver Cowdery] represents Joseph as sitting by a table with the plates before him. and he reading the record with the Urim & Thummim. Oliver, his scribe, sits close beside to hear and write every word as translated. This is done by holding the translators over the words of the written record, and the translation appears distinctly in the instrument, which had been touched by the finger of God and dedicated and consecated for the express purpose of translating languages. This instrument now used fully performed its Mission. Every word was made distinctly visible even to every letter, and if Oliver did not in writing spell the word correctly it remained in the translator until it was written correctly. This was the Mystery to Oliver, how Joseph being compar[a]tively ignorant could correct him in spelling, without seeing the word written, and he would not be satisfied until he should be permitted or have the gift to translate as well as Joseph.
