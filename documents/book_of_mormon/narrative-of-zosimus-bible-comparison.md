Using chatgpt4o (2024-09-10) and my transcript (link) of the Greek version of the Narrative of Zosimus I created a side-by-side comparison similar to Welch's original comparison with the Book of Mormon (Welch also only did a columnar comparison with the Greek). I used this prompt:

_Please make two columns. On the left, the entire text that I'm pasting in, in reasonable thematic chunks for comparison. On the right, please include the bible reference and text for the bible verses that are most similar to the text I have input. The final output should be markdown formatted code._

_I have not yet validated chatgpt4o's output, and it is known to hallucinate, so all output should be taken with caution._

## Chapter 1


| **NoZ** | **Bible Reference** |
|----------------|---------------------|
| About that time there was in the desert a certain man named Zosimus, [who for forty years ate no bread, and drank no wine, and saw not the face of man.] | **Matthew 4:1-2** - "Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry." |
| This man was entreating God that he might see the way of life of the blessed, and behold an angel of the Lord was sent saying to him, Zosimus, man of God, behold I am sent by the Most High, the God of all, to tell thee that thou shalt journey to the blessed, but shall not dwell with them. | **Genesis 28:12-13** - "And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it! And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, 'I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac.'" |
| [But exalt not thy heart, saying, For forty years I have not eaten bread, for the word of God is more than bread, and the spirit of God is more than wine.] | **Deuteronomy 8:3** - "He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord." |
| And as for thy saying, I have not seen the face of man, behold the face of the great king is nigh thee. | **1 Corinthians 13:12** - "For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known." |
| Zosimus said, I know that the Lord can do whatsoever he will. | **Job 42:2** - "I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted." |
| The angel said to him, Know this also, that thou art not worthy of one of their delights, but arise and set out. | **Isaiah 6:5** - "Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts." |

| **NoZ**                                                                                                          | **Bible Reference & Text**                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| And I, Zosimus, issuing from my cave with God leading me, set out not knowing which way I went...                      | **Genesis 12:1 (NIV):** "The Lord had said to Abram, 'Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you.'"                        |
| After I had travelled forty days my spirit grew faint and my body failed...                                             | **1 Kings 19:8 (NIV):** "So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God."  |
| ...being exhausted I sat down, and continued praying in that place for three days.                                      | **Acts 9:9 (NIV):** "For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything."                                                                                    |
| A beast from the desert, whose name is the camel, and placing its knees on the ground, it received me upon its neck...  | **Isaiah 30:6 (NIV):** "...envoys travel on the backs of donkeys, on the camels through the desert, to a people that will not help them."                                |
| There was much howling of wild beasts, and gnashing of teeth, and deadly poison.                                        | **Matthew 8:12 (NIV):** "But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."                   |
| And becoming afraid, I prayed to the Lord, and there came in that place a great earthquake with noise...                | **Acts 16:26 (NIV):** "Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open..."            |
| ...a storm of wind blew and lifted me from the earth, and exalted me on its wing...                                     | **Isaiah 40:31 (NIV):** "...but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary..."           |
| ...and I was praying and journeying till it set me upon a place beside a river, and the name of the river is Eumeles.   | **Ezekiel 47:5 (NIV):** "...but now it was a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in—a river that no one could cross."   |
| ...some one cried as if from the water, saying, Zosimus, man of God, thou canst not pass through me,                    | **Exodus 14:21 (NIV):** "Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the Lord drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land." |
| ...look up from the waters to the heaven...                                                                             | **Psalm 121:1-2 (NIV):** "I lift up my eyes to the mountains—where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth."                  |
| And looking up I saw a wall of cloud stretching from the waters to the heaven...                                        | **Exodus 14:19 (NIV):** "Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel’s army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them..." |
| The cloud said, Zosimus, man of God, through me no bird passes out of this world...                                     | **Genesis 28:12 (NIV):** "He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it." |

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| And I was astonished at these words, and at the voice that spake these things to me.                                    | **Daniel 8:15-16 (ESV):** “When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. And behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man. And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the Ulai, and it called, ‘Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.’”                                                                                     |
| And as I prayed, behold two trees sprang up out of the earth, fair and beautiful, laden with fragrant fruits.           | **Genesis 2:9 (NIV):** “The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.”                                                                                                                                   |
| And the tree on this side bent down and received me on its top, and was lifted up exceedingly above the middle of the river, | **Psalm 1:3 (KJV):** “And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.”                                                                                                                                                                        |
| and the other tree met me and received me in its branches and bending down set me on the ground;                        | **John 15:5 (NIV):** “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| and both trees were lifted up and set me away from the river on the other side.                                         | **Revelation 22:2 (NIV):** “Down the middle of the great street of the city, on each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.”                                                                                                                    |
| In that place I rested three days, and arising again.                                                                   | **Jonah 1:17 (ESV):** “And the Lord appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| I went forward, whither I knew not, and that place was filled with much fragrance,                                      | **Song of Solomon 2:13 (NIV):** “The fig tree forms its early fruit; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance. Arise, come, my darling; my beautiful one, come with me.”                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| and there was no mountain on either hand, but the place was level and flowery, all crowned with garlands, and all the land was beautiful. | **Isaiah 35:1-2 (NIV):** “The desert and the parched land will be glad; the wilderness will rejoice and blossom. Like the crocus, it will burst into bloom; it will rejoice greatly and shout for joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; they will see the glory of the Lord, the splendor of our God.”                                    |

| And I saw there a naked man sitting, and said in myself, Surely this is not the tempter.                                                      | **Genesis 3:10** - "He answered, 'I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.'"                      |
| And I remembered the voice of the cloud that it said to me, Not even the tempter in this world passes through me.                             | **Job 1:7** - "The Lord said to Satan, 'Where have you come from?' Satan answered the Lord, 'From roaming throughout the earth.'"   |
| And thus taking courage I said to him, Hail, brother.                                                                                         | **1 Peter 5:14** - "Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ."                                  |
| And he answering said to me, The grace of my God be with thee.                                                                                | **2 Thessalonians 3:18** - "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all."                                                    |
| Again I said to him, Tell me, man of God, who thou art?                                                                                       | **2 Kings 1:9** - "Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty. He went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, 'Man of God, the king says, "Come down!"'" |
| He answered and said to me, Who art thou rather? And I answered and told him all concerning myself, and that I had prayed to God and he had brought me into that place. | **Acts 9:5** - "Who are you, Lord?' Saul asked. 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,' he replied."                               |
| He answered and said to me, I also know that thou art a man of God, for if not, thou couldst not have passed through the cloud and the river and the air. | **2 Kings 5:15** - "Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God. He stood before him and said, 'Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel.'" |
| For the breadth of the river is about thirty thousand paces, and the cloud reaches to heaven, and the depth of the river to the abyss.         | **Revelation 22:1** - "Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb." |

| And looking up into heaven I saw his face as the face of an angel, and his clothing as lightning, which passes from the east to the west,             | **Matthew 28:3 (KJV):** "His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| and I was greatly afraid, thinking that it was the son of God, and trembled, falling upon the ground.                                                | **Matthew 17:6 (KJV):** "And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| And giving me his hand he raised me up, saying, Arise, I also am one of the blessed.                                                                 | **Acts 9:6 (KJV):** "And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Come with me, that I may lead thee to the elders. And laying hold of my hand he walked about with me and led me toward a certain crowd,              | **Revelation 4:4 (KJV):** "And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| and there were in that crowd elders like sons of God, and young men were standing beside the elders.                                                 | **Job 1:6 (KJV):** "Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| And as I came near to them, they said, This man has come hither out of the vanity of the world; come, let us beseech the Lord and he will reveal to us this mystery. | **Jeremiah 33:3 (KJV):** "Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Surely the end is not at hand, that the man of vanity is come hither?                                                                                | **2 Peter 3:4 (KJV):** "And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Then they arose and besought the Lord with one accord,                                                                                               | **Acts 1:14 (KJV):** "These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| and behold two angels came down from heaven and said, Fear not the man, for God has sent him, that he may remain seven days and learn your ways of life, | **Acts 10:3-4 (KJV):** "He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God."                                                                                                                                                                   |
| and then he shall go forth and depart to his own place.                                                                                              | **John 16:28 (KJV):** "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Then the elders of the blessed gave me over to one of the attendants, saying, Keep him for seven days.                             | Genesis 37:36 - "Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard."                                          |
| So the attendant receiving me led me to his cave, and we sat under a tree partaking of food.                                       | 1 Kings 19:4-5 - "But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness... and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die... and an angel touched him." |
| For from the sixth hour even to the sixth, then we ate, and the water came out from the root of the tree sweeter than honey...     | Exodus 15:25 - "Moses cried unto the Lord, and the Lord showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became sweet."                                  |
| And all the country of those there heard of me, that there had come thither a man out of the vanity of the world...                | 1 Kings 10:1 - "When the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon and his relationship to the Lord, she came to test Solomon with hard questions."                      |
| Therefore they were asking me all things and I was answering them, and I became faint in spirit and in body...                     | Matthew 11:28 - "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."                                                                                   |
| I beseech thee, brother, if any come to see me, tell them He is not here, so that I may rest a little.                             | Matthew 14:23 - "After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone."                                         |
| Woe is me, that the story of Adam is summed up in me, for Satan deceived him through Eve, and this man by his flattery...          | Genesis 3:13 - "Then the Lord God said to the woman, 'What is this you have done?' The woman said, 'The serpent deceived me, and I ate.'"                                     |
| Take me away from hence, for I shall flee from the place.                                                                          | Genesis 19:17 - "When they had brought them out, one said, 'Flee for your lives! Don’t look back, and don’t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains.'"              |
| For behold he wishes to sow in me seeds of the world of vanity.                                                                    | 1 John 2:16 - "For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father, but is of the world."                   |
| And all the multitude and the elders rose up against me, and said, Depart from us, man; we know not whence thou art come to us.     | John 9:29 - "We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don’t even know where he comes from."                                                               |
| But I lamented with great lamentation, and my senses left me...                                                                    | Job 30:25 - "Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor?"                                                                                     |
| I besought the Lord to come to you, and he deemed me worthy.                                                                       | Isaiah 6:8 - "Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, 'Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?' And I said, 'Here am I. Send me!'"                                      |
| And the elders said, And now what wilt thou we should do to thee?                                                                  | Matthew 27:22 - "Pilate said to them, 'What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?' They all answered, 'Crucify him!'"                                      |
| I said to them, I desire to learn of you your way of life.                                                                         | Luke 10:39 - "She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said."                                                                            |

| And taking up tables of stone they wrote on them with their nails,                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Exodus 24:12**: "And the Lord said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written."          |
| Thus, hear, ye sons of men, hear ye us who are become blessed, that we also are of you;                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Psalm 34:11**: "Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord."                                                                                                 |
| For when the prophet Jeremiah proclaimed that the city of Jerusalem should be delivered into the hands of the destroyers, he rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and sprinkled dust upon his head,                                                                 | **Jeremiah 38:6**: "Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon...and he sank in the mire."                                                                                         |
| And told all people to turn from their wicked way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Jeremiah 18:11**: "Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I frame evil against you...return ye now every one from his evil way."                                                                       |
| And our father Rechab, the son of Aminadab, heard him and said to us, Ye sons and daughters of Rechab, hearken to your father, and put off your garments from your body, and drink no vessel of wine, and eat no bread from the fire, and drink not strong drink and honey...       | **Jeremiah 35:6**: "But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever."          |
| And we said, All that he has commanded us we shall do and hearken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Exodus 19:8**: "And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do."                                                                                   |
| So we cast away our clothing from our bodies, and we ate no bread from the fire, and drank no vessel of wine nor honey nor strong drink, and we lamented with a great lamentation and besought the Lord, and he heard our prayer...                                                | **Jonah 3:5**: "So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them."                                      |
| And turned away his anger from the city of Jerusalem, and there came to the city of Jerusalem mercy from the Lord, and he pitied its people, and turned away his deadly anger.                                                                                                     | **2 Chronicles 30:9**: "For the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him."                                                     |
| **8. And after these things the king of the city of Jerusalem died, and there arose another king.** | 2 Kings 23:30 - "And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead." |
| **And all the people gathered to him and informed him concerning us, and said, There are certain of thy people, who have changed their way from us.** | Daniel 3:12 - "There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up." |
| **Therefore the king summoned them, and asked them wherefore they had done this; and he sent for us and asked, Who are ye and of what worship and of what country?** | Acts 21:33-34 - "Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done. And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle." |
| **And we said to him, We are the sons of thy servant, and our father is Rechab the son of Jonadab, and when Jeremiah the prophet preached in the days of thy father the king, he proclaimed death to the city of Jerusalem, saying, Yet three days and all the city shall be put to death.** | Jeremiah 35:6 - "But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever." Jeremiah 26:12 - "Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard." |
| **And the king thy father hearing this repented of his sins, and issued a command to all to turn aside from their wicked way.** | Jonah 3:6-8 - "For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands." |
| **And our father thy servant hearing it charged us, saying, Drink no vessel of wine, and eat no bread from the fire, until the Lord shall hear your entreaty.** | Jeremiah 35:6 - "But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever." |
| **And we hearkened to the commandment of our father, and made naked our bodies, we drank no wine and ate no bread, and we prayed to the Lord for the city of Jerusalem, and the Lord pitied his people and turned away his anger, and we saw it and our soul was rejoiced, and we said, It is good for us to be so.** | Jeremiah 35:8-10 - "Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed: But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us." |
| And the king said to us, Ye have done well. Now therefore mingle with my people, and eat bread and drink wine, and glorify your Lord, and ye shall be serving God and the king. | **Ecclesiastes 9:7** - "Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved what you do." |
| But we said, We will not disobey God.                                                            | **Acts 5:29** - "But Peter and the apostles answered, 'We must obey God rather than men.'"                       |
| Then the king was enraged and set us in prison, and we passed that night there.                  | **Acts 16:23-24** - "And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely." |
| And behold a light shone in the building, and an angel uncovered the prison and laid hold of the crowns of our heads, and took us out of the prison...    | **Acts 12:7** - "And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, 'Get up quickly.' And the chains fell off his hands." |
| ...and set us beside the water of the river, and said to us, Whithersoever the water goes, go ye also. | **Ezekiel 47:9** - "And wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish." |
| And we travelled with the water and with the angel.                                              | **Exodus 23:20** - "Behold, I send an angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared." |
| When therefore he had brought us to this place, the river was dried up and the water was swallowed up by the abyss... | **Revelation 16:12** - "The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the east." |
| ...and he made a wall round this country, and there came a wall of cloud, and shadowed above the water; and he did not scatter us over all the earth, but gave to us this country. | **Exodus 13:21** - "And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night." |

| 10. Hear, ye sons of men, hear the way of life of the blessed. For God placed us in this land, for we are holy but not immortal. | "Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth." — Matthew 5:5 <br> "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." — Romans 6:23                                                                        |
| For the earth produces most fragrant fruit, and out of the trunks of the trees comes water sweeter than honey, and these are our food and drink. | "And the LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food." — Genesis 2:9 <br> "He will give the rain for your land in its season, and the land will yield its fruit." — Deuteronomy 11:14             |
| We are also praying night and day, and this is all our occupation.                                        | "Pray without ceasing." — 1 Thessalonians 5:17 <br> "Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak." — Matthew 26:41                                                                                              |
| Hear, ye sons of men; with us there is no vine, nor ploughed field, nor works of wood or iron, nor have we any house or building, nor fire nor sword, nor iron wrought or unwrought, nor silver nor gold, nor air too heavy or too keen. | "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven." — Matthew 6:19-20                                                                          |
| Neither do any of us take to themselves wives, except for so long as to beget two children, and after they have produced two children they withdraw from each other and continue in chastity, not knowing that they were ever in the intercourse of marriage, but being in virginity as from the beginning. | "But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain even as I am... but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion." — 1 Corinthians 7:8-9                               |
| And the one child remains for marriage, and the other for virginity.                                      | "There are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others—and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven." — Matthew 19:12                                                      |
| 11. And there is no count of time, neither weeks nor months nor years, for all our day is one day.                                | 2 Peter 3:8 - "But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."                                                                                                                                                                          |
| In our caves lie the leaves of trees, and this is our couch under the trees.                                                 | Genesis 3:7 - "Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings."                                                                                                                                                         |
| But we are not naked of body, as ye wrongly imagine, for we have the garment of immortality and are not ashamed of each other.| 1 Corinthians 15:53 - "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| At the sixth hour of every day we eat, for the fruit of the tree falls of itself at the sixth hour, and we eat and drink...   | Genesis 1:29 - "And God said, 'See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.'"                                                                                                                           |
| ...again the water sinks into its place.                                                                                     | Genesis 2:6 - "But a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground."                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| We also know you who are there in the world, and who are in sins, and your works, for every day the angels of the Lord come...| Hebrews 4:13 - "And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account."                                                                                                                                                                     |
| But we pray for you to the Lord, because we also are of you and of your race...                                              | 1 Timothy 2:1 - "Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men."                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ...except that God has chosen us, and has set us in this place without sin.                                                  | Ephesians 1:4 - "Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love."                                                                                                                                                                           |
