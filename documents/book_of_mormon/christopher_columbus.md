Washington Irving, author of the highly popular book [The Legend of Sleepy Hollow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow) (1820), wrote and published a biography about Christopher Columbus in 1828.  The Columbus of the Book of Mormon may have been inspired by this source.

The Book of Mormon study guide [says this](https://www.lds.org/manual/book-of-mormon-student-study-guide/1-nephi-13?lang=eng):

> **1 Nephi 13:12—Who Was the “Man among the Gentiles”?**

> Nephi saw “a man among the Gentiles” whom the “Spirit of God” inspired to sail to where the descendants of Lehi would be in the promised land. Christopher Columbus is a remarkable match for the man Nephi described. Columbus wrote: “From my first youth onward, I was a seaman and have so continued until this day. … The Lord was well disposed to my desire, and He bestowed upon me courage and understanding; knowledge of seafaring He gave me in abundance. … Our Lord unlocked my mind, sent me upon the sea, and gave me fire for the deed. Those who heard of my [enterprise] called it foolish, mocked me, and laughed. But who can doubt but that the Holy Ghost inspired me?” (from Jacob Wassermann, Columbus, Don Quixote of the Seas, 19–20, 46; italics added; cited in McConkie and Millet, Doctrinal Commentary on the Book of Mormon, 1:91).
