Dan McClellan, the [Scripture Translation Supervisor for the LDS
Church](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielomcclellan/), was asked:

> What are your thoughts on the historicity of the Book of Mormon in light of
> your understanding of the documentary hypothesis?

On August 3, 2021, [he responded](https://www.tiktok.com/@maklelan/video/6992346299206995205):

> Thank you for the question. This is probably the biggest challenge that's facing
> Latter-day Saint apologists these days.  How can they account for the Book
> of Mormon as a translation while also confronting the indisputable fact that
> it quotes from Biblical passages that were composed centuries after Lehi and
> his family left Jerusalem with the Brass Plates, and even more challenging
> that it quotes directly from the King James version of those passages
> including some translation errors and idiosyncrasies unique to the King
> James version?  Some scholars try to discount the Documentary Hypothesis or
> Deutero Isaiah as a way to side-step the challenge.  That has not ultimately
> proven to be successful---I don't think it can be.  I think apologists are
> going to have to confront the fact that Joseph Smith played a role in the
> articulation of the text in some way, shape, or form.
