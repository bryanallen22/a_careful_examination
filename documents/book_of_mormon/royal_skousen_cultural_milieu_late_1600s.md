Royal Skousen, a believing Latter-day Saint scholar, [recently wrote in the pro-LDS Interpreter](https://www.mormoninterpreter.com/tyndale-versus-more-in-the-book-of-mormon/#more-6220):

> Alexander Campbell claimed in his early review of the Book of Mormon (in 1831) that Joseph Smith’s golden bible was simply commenting on the religious issues of the early 1800s in America. To the contrary, there is considerable evidence that **the issues and the cultural milieu of the text date more from the late 1600s than the early 1800s**, during a time when the conflicts between the low-church Protestants, high-church Anglicans, and Catholics had been basically resolved (or at least reached a kind of peaceful truce in England). **References to “secret combinations” and to “standing at the bar of God to be judged” can be more reasonably traced to this period**, not to the early 1800s (or to biblical usage). The translation issues that Thomas More attacked William Tyndale over were basically settled in the King James Bible (1611), yet the Book of Mormon takes those translation issues to their final conclusion by explicitly resolving the conflict by (1) frequently declaring charity to be love, as in the “pure love of Christ”, (2) allowing for both elders and priests as offices in the church, and (3) explicitly stating that the word church refers to both congregation and God’s organization. **The Book of Mormon resolves the controversy in favor of the King James solution but from the point of view of William Tyndale.** (emphasis added)
