Angola is a named place in the Book of Mormon. It's distinct because it shares no prefixes or suffixes commonly seen in other names. It is more like those copied from Biblical and Masonic sources.

> "But Joseph couldn't have borrowed the name from the town of Angola, NY, because it wasn't named until 1855" 

- some apologist, somewhere.

Well, Angola is a Portuguese variation of the word king, 'ngola'. The Portuguese were there mainly for slaves until Portugal [banned the practice in 1836](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Angola). Angola, New York was named after the African country by local Quakers in 1855. Quakers of the 19th century were known to be abolitionists, and were quite active in Underground Railroad during the 1810s-1820s. Knowing the link between slavery and Angola, it's likely Quakers of the time discussed the geography.

Was Joseph well aquainted with Quakers? Why, yes. They were quite well known back then. Also, as some of you know [Mr. Lemuel Durfee](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1985/08/a-snug-log-house?lang=eng), a Quaker, bailed out his family farm in 1825. Lemuel. Africa.
