### Faith Crisis Report 

[Faith_Crisis_Report_R24B.pdf]({{ "/documents/faith_crisis_study/Faith_Crisis_Report_R24B.pdf" | relative_url }})

Report prepared for Dieter Uchtdorf in 2013 [meaning that he was the target audience, **not** that he or any other Church leader commissioned the report], presented to him by Marlin Jensen. The report includes a recap of the 2011 research and was meant to inform him and other general authorities so they could better understand what is happening (and take appropriate measures to compassionately address it).

### Faith Crisis Chronicles

[Faith_Crisis_Accounts_R3.pdf]({{ "/documents/faith_crisis_study/Faith_Crisis_Accounts_R3.pdf" | relative_url }})

Includes a number of qualitative narratives collected in 2013 as part of a separate survey (some of these inputs were included in the Uchtdorf report).  Uchtdorf later indicated that he read each of these narratives.

### BYU-H Symposium Presentation

[BYU_H_Social+Faith_R5.pdf]({{ "/documents/faith_crisis_study/BYU_H_Social+Faith_R5.pdf" | relative_url }})

Part of this presentation focused on “user generated content” in the post-Mormon community and included a site-traffic analysis and growth projection for the r/exmormon subreddit. Back in Oct 2016, there were 34K registered members of that community. Today there are almost 97K registered members, which is more or less on target per the projection to reach 200K in 2020. And while the number of registered users is impressive, the number of “lurkers” and level of engagement per user is especially fascinating. See Slides 17–31 for more info.

Finally, please note that this project was pro-bono work (conducted without pay and without being commissioned by Church leadership).  These are NOT official LDS reports, internal or otherwise.

edit: Clarification about target audience and the non-official nature of the work.  Also, added the Initial Report section and included mention of John Dehlin as co-lead on the project.
