[DRAFT]

## Encourage outside sources

[implied by Fair, BYU Studies, and the Maxwell Institute reviewing difficult sources]

## Discourage outside sources


### During missionary service

From [2017 Mobile Device Standards](https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/documents/b/b6/2017-Mobile_Device_Standards.pdf):

> Leave social media groups and stop following organizations or websites that do not reflect your calling as a representative of the Lord. 

> Ensure that you use an approved device that is enrolled in Church protections.

["Church protections" probably includes blocking critical material? Should verify this.]

> With your companion, create a culture of helping each other be safe by regularly and thoroughly reviewing each other’s devices. In reviewing your companion’s device, look at his or her app histories, recent contacts, photos, notes, usage information, and so on. Do not reset your device or erase your online history. As directed by your mission president, missionary leaders may also conduct device reviews.

> Always sit or stand so that you and your companion can see each other’s screen when using devices. Be aware of your companion’s contacts, messages, and communication. Also make sure that your companion reviews anything you plan to email, post, comment, or message except for letters to your mission president and emails home.
