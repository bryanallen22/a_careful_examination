## What is morality?

At its core morality is concern with the well-being of others (specifically, those that may care about their own well-being).[^normative]  Where well-being is clear-cut, easily understood, and universally agreed upon, then morality in those cases is also clear-cut, easily understood and universally agreed upon (e.g., killing a happy person just for fun is clearly an act against their well-being and hence a moral crime if perpetrated by someone who is aware of that.).

## Does sex impact the well-being of individuals?

**Absolutely**.

The well-being of an individual in relation to sexuality is complex, hence reasoning about morality around sexuality is also difficult.    There may be exceptions to each of these points because individual well-being is somewhat individual (and especially when it comes to sex).  Still, certain ideas seem to apply generally (for instance, moral obligation to look after offspring produced from sexual intercourse).

These are the basic moral concerns regarding heterosexual-couplings[^othercouplings]:

1. Sex is highly pleasurable for most (hence the act directly contributes to a person's well-being).
1. Coitus is the overwhelmingly dominant form of reproduction of our species.  Even if people are divided on over-population concerns, almost everyone can agree that _some_ level of reproduction of the species is a moral good.
1. The well-being of offspring potentially produced by such a coupling ought to be a prime consideration since such offspring are moral subjects themselves.  Children produced in monogamous or near-monogamous relationships will have greater access to resources both from parents and [grandparents](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/24/prehistoric-man-helped-as-elderly-survived) (the influence of grandparents on the success of homo sapiens is well-documented).  Where lineage is uncertain, patriarchal and grand-parent involvement is less likely to occur [to ill-effect](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/07/single_motherhood_worse_for_children_.html).  In any event, it seems straightforward to suggest that both men and women have a moral duty to nurture and provide for the offspring they produce, and long-term, monogamous coupling is the most straightforward way to satisfy that moral obligation (although one's moral duty towards offspring may be discharged via other arrangements successfully, too---for instance single mothers by choice [seem to be as successful in child-rearing as couples](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4886836/)).
1. There are issues of attachment and bonding to consider (can be a positive and negative depending on the relationship). (e.g., [oxytocin](http://psychcentral.com/news/2012/11/15/can-oxytocin-improve-fidelity-within-relationships/47728.html)).
1. Sexuality within the context of a committed relationship is often described as being highly rewarding (can peruse [r/sex](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/) for many anecdotes).  Still, novel sexual arrangements may be viewed as rewarding by some, and sex within a committed relationship may also suffer its own challenges [when one or both partners lose sexual motivation](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/) for a variety of reasons.
1. Sexually transmitted diseases [negatively impact a person's well-being](https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/sexually-transmitted-diseases).
1. Women typically have less access to resources but the difference in sexual appetite (on average) between men and women lead to [sex as a female resource](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/sites/carlsonschool.umn.edu/files/faculty/publications/71503.pdf).  Hence, there are genuine concerns with the exploitation of women for sex and sexual experience.
1. Sex comes at a significantly higher potential cost for women in the event of a unwanted (or even wanted) pregnancy: an abortion comes at [some cost](http://americanpregnancy.org/unplanned-pregnancy/abortion-emotional-effects/) (for all women with the physical/pharmaceutical procedure and the emotional toll experienced by *some* women).  [Pregnancy, labor, delivery](http://www.womenshealthcaretopics.com/physical_health_consequences_of_pregnancy_and_delivery.htm), [nursing](http://www.bustle.com/articles/33882-breastfeeding-is-so-hard-sometimes-7-truths-about-breastfeeding-i-learned-the-hard-way), and raising the child fall primarily or entirely on the woman (so massive disparity in impact of pregnancy).
1. The genetic and physical health of offspring (hence [the general ban on incest](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animals-and-us/201210/the-problem-incest)).
1. Mammals seem to be easily conditioned in their sexual expression (see [rat death pheromone experiments](http://66.199.228.237/boundary/addiction/boundary/animal_models_of_human_sexual_response.pdf)), hence we probably have some obligation to engage in sexuality in ways that positively influence our future sexual behavior.
1. Monogamy (or not) [plays a role in our species survival](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201308/monogamy-researchers-disagree-why-mate-fidelity-evolved).

## Conclusions

The first two points by themselves seem to argue for unrestrained sex between consenting adults. The rest of the points generally argue in favor of thoughtful/restrained sexual expression, at least to some degree.  Of course, how to weigh all these considerations is its own challenge, and different societies have managed these multitudinous moral concerns in sometimes vastly different ways (e.g., compare [the Inis Beag with the Mangaians](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cultural_differences_in_sexuality)).

To some significant extent effective/semi-effective birth control methods swing the calculus of sexual morality towards giving/receiving pleasure and bonding for its own sake and away from concerns about offspring which have dominated moral considerations of sexuality in times past.  Also, in general, where societies jointly care for offspring (i.e., paternity is of little concern because all children will be cared for) or where women can control their reproductive future (i.e., many modern Western societies), sexual expression seems more abundant and egalitarian (again suggesting that these moral considerations are under equilibrium-type pressure and moral optima may vary somewhat depending on social norms and constraints).

[^normative]: The description of morality I use above is normative (i.e., [we should do certain things](https://www.reddit.com/r/MormonDoctrine/comments/89kb1f/claim_morality_is_an_emergent_principle/) in order to maximize well-being of, and minimize harm to, conscious creatures).  Other formulations of morality are descriptive (e.g. [moral foundations theory](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jessegra/papers/GHKMIWD.inpress.MFT.AESP.pdf)), and one could easily examine sex from within that kind of context and it would still be rife with moral considerations.

[^othercouplings]:  Moral ramifications for homosexuality and autosexuality also exist, but this document focuses on the moral ramifications of heterosexual sex, which is arguably more intrinsically complex than the others.
