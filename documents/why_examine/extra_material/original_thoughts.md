I think you should at least read through the basic arguments that suggest the
foundational truth claims of the Church might not be true.  Here is my
thinking.

## I dedicated most of my life to the gospel

By virtue of all the time I've spent studying and living the gospel, the
sacrifices I've made in time, body, money, and spirit for the gospel, and my
diligence and efforts as a member, I believe I should have earned the
privilege of being able to share these specific issues.  I do not deserve to
be dismissed as insincere, deceived, or merely wanting to sin.  The balance of
my life is a witness of my sincerity and willingness to offer my self--body,
mind, and soul--to doing what is right and true.[^dedication]

## Our family has proselyted for nearly 100,000 hours.

Every male in our immediate family spent upwards of 8,000 hours on their 2
year proselyting mission knocking on doors and asking people to listen to a
message and come to church with them.  Collectively, all 7 males have spent
about 60,000 hours trying to share that message with other people in this
world.  That number approaches 100,000 hours if you count all our immediate
in-laws.

By virtue of all the time our family has spent trying to share truth with
others in this world, it seems reasonable to ask that you listen to my
reasons, at least for an hour or two.

## We've listened to about 100,000 hours of basic Church instruction.

If you are roughly 40 years old, then you've spent, at a bare minimum, over
5,000 hours in church instruction.

If you count in-laws (and not children) then our family has logged somewhere
around 100,000 hours of 3-hour block instruction.

By virtue of all the time our family has spent in Church instruction, it seems
reasonable to ask that you listen to my reasons, at least for an hour or two.

## Our family has donated over $1,000,000 dollars to the Church

Back of the envelope calculation.  If you count Dad and Mom and all of us
siblings, the amount comes to at least 1 million dollars.

Given the amount of money we have given to this Church and the amount we may continue to
give to this Church, it seems reasonable to ask that a person consider the
specific arguments for why the Church might not be true, at least for an hour
or two.

## We've never talked about the specific issues

Given the fact that I had dedicated my life and soul to the gospel for two
decades, and given the amount of time, effort, and money this family has
dedicated to the Church, I anticipated that I would end up having many long
discussions about the specific things I'd discovered that cast light on the
foundational truth claims of the church.  If I was in error, perhaps someone
could show me how I was wrong, or if I was lacking perspective, maybe someone
else had it?

As it turns out, in the time since I've experienced this faith transition
(about 1.5 years now), these are the statistics describing my interactions
with other believing members:

The number of times someone has asked to talk with me about my specific concerns: 0
The number of hours I have spent explaining the specific issues I have to a member of my family (of believing members): 0

To me, that seems crazy.  Why wouldn't a single member of my own family be
willing to talk with my about the specific issues?  I thought about all the
reasons why a person would not want to talk with me.

## Reasons to *not* read/listen to the specific issues

What are the reasons why a person would not want to read or even consider the
specific issues that might undermine the foundational truth claims?

1. Some people do not really care whether the Church is true or not.  Even if it was
   conclusively proven that the Book of Mormon were a fraud, or the Q15
   released material from their vault conclusively proving the church wasn't
   true, they would continue living the LDS program for the rest of their life.
   To them, the Church is a way of life that makes them happy and they are bound
   and determined to live it regardless of its truth.  **Response:** This
   seems like an incoherent position to me.  A big part of the Gospel way of life is
   trying to live truth and helping others.  How can a person be content
   living within a system that claims to seek all truth while simultaneously being
   unconcerned with the truthfulness of that very system?  If the Church were
   not true, then they could potentially be helping others more effectively
   outside of the institution.
2. They are afraid that they will be deceived.  They are afraid that they will be
   tricked into believing something that isn't true and forfeit their eternal
   salvation and happiness for a lie.  A variant of this is that they fear
   being tricked into even engaging with the questions, and hence lose the ability
   to live by faith alone (i.e., the very act of engaging with the question of
   the veracity of the truth-claims means they will lose the ability to
   spiritually discern its truthfulness).  **Response:** BYU professors and
   LDS apologists are willing to read and review virtually any book attacking
   the foundational truth claims of the Church. The gospel topics essays on
   lds.org were written by LDS historians willing to engage with the whole
   spectrum of historical sources and opinions.  They do not seem to be
   worried that engaging with the arguments and the raw data will cloud their
   ability to discern truth. BYU religion scholars often quote Austin Farrar:
   "Though argument does not create conviction, lack of it destroys belief.
   What seems to be proved may not be embraced; but what no one shows that
   ability to defend is quickly abandoned. Rational argument does not create
   belief, but it maintains a climate in which belief may flourish."  Even if
   the ultimate truth must be obtained spiritually, it still stands to reason
   that if the Church is true then it can withstand rational investigation.
3. You would rather not invest the time and effort that an engagement in the
   issues might bring. **Response:** A dedicated member is willing to dedicate 156 hours
   every year to the 3 hour block of meetings and another ~180 hours every
   year engaged in scripture study and prayer.  If a deep study of the
   truth-claims ends up being necessary to determine their validity, that
   doesn't seem like too much to ask in comparison to the amount of time a
   person already dedicates to receiving pro-Church messages and maintaining
   their spirituality.  And if the Church ends up not being true, then that
   person just freed up 300 hours every year to do with as they wish (so, potentially
   a big return of time on what they might have sacrificed up front in
   examining the issues).
4. You are afraid that the Church might not be true. If the Church isn't true,
   then you will end up having to face countless uncomfortable questions,
   situations, and unknowns as you deal with that truth.  You would have to
   face the idea that you have given most of your life and much of your money
   to a Church that wasn't what it claimed to be.  You would need to
   re-evaluate all your ideas about God, life after death, the efficacy of
   prayer, ethics and morality, the purpose of family, and the meaning of this
   life, but all without the scaffold provided by the Church. **Response:**
   It's definitely an adventure.  If the Church isn't true, then you can join
   me in trying to figure it all out without the Church scaffold.  I do maintain
   that there are countless truths and principles that I learned as a member
   of the church that remain true even if the foundational truth-claims of the
   Church do not hold up.  Everything good and true remains good and true.
   (Also, consider Lynne Kelly quote [^lynne_kelly])
   So, your worst fears are probably unfounded.
5. You've had spiritual experiences that confirm the truth, and that is enough
   for you.  **Response:** You don't know what you don't know.  Is it possible
   that there is another way of thinking about the spiritual experiences
   you've had that makes sense of those experiences even better than the way
   you are thinking about them right now?  And, if you are that confident in your
   spiritual experiences, then what do you fear from considering an
   alternative explanation?  (Said another way, if your faith can move
   mountatins, then it should be able to withstand inspection).  If Moroni's promise is indeed true (i.e., by the
   Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things), then you should be able to
   use that method to vet the truth behind these specific issues.

## Reasons to investigate the issues:

Note, there is some natural overlap with the responses given above.

1. After you've explored the issues, then you never have to be afraid or
   worried about what you don't know.  You know that your beliefs have
   withstood scrutiny.  You can comfortably converse with post-mormons on any
   topic.  You know that you will not really be surprised by any new finding
   or argument.
2. Spending the time to really understand another person's point of view--even
   when it might feel threatening to your own position--is consonant with the
   highest principles that should be followed to build strong family
   relationships.  You demonstrate that the other person is important to you,
   you open channels of communication, and you may be less judgemental of them
   after you have spent some time examining the same data and arguments that
   they have examined.[^family relationships]
3. If you can see flaws in their logic or evidence, you may become able to
   show them (and others) the error of their ways and potentially bring them
   back to the fold (or perhaps be better able to accept the idea that they
   might not return).
4. If a person is going to commit their money, time, and effort into building
   up the Church, and spend thousands of hours listening to pro-Church
   messages prepared for the Church, it seems only fair that at some point
   they be given the chance to hear an opposing viewpoint, clearly
   articulated.
5. If the Church is not true, you deserve to know about that possibility right
   now.  The past is gone, but you can alter your future course consonant with
   that newfound understanding, beginning today.  From what I can tell, most
   exmormons wish they had known the truth sooner. [^truth sooner]
6. If Moroni's promise is indeed true (by the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth
   of all things), then you should be able to use it to vet the truth behind
   these specific issues.

## The advice to *not* examine the evidence is incoherent


[^dedication]: I mowed hundreds of lawns in the blistering heat and humidity.  I moved homes and
apartments.  I cleaned out abandoned homes.  I waited thousands of tables.  I sold gallons of soda and popcorn, and swept a ton of theaters.  Virtually all the money I made from the age of 8 until 19 I spent on my
mission (and some of dad and mom's money, to make up the difference).

I worked my tail-end off every single day and virtually every single hour as a
missionary.  I more or less fried my eyes from wearing contacts because I
decided to wear my contacts my entire mission because I wanted to put
everything on the altar, including my eyesight if necessary, to give my whole
self to preaching the gospel (didn't want to be distracted by glasses while
trying to preach).  I skipped or skimped on more meals than I can count
because I preferred to preach over wasting time on food.  I was robbed at
gunpoint and shot in the foot because I was willing to go into the worst
areas of my mission to find anyone who might be willing to hear the message.  I
knocked doors and taught people until the last hour of the last day on my
mission.

As an adult, I read the Book of Mormon upwards of 40 times.  I read each of
the other standard works (except the OT--didn't quite finish it) many times.
I've thoroughly studied every Institute manual (BoM, OT 1&2, NT, D&C, PoGP,
etc, Church History in the Fulness of Times).  As a missionary, I read the
entire missionary library (including the footnotes).  Beginning in graduate
school I listened repeatedly to all the general conference talks given each
half year.

For the past several years I have been a subscriber to BYU Studies, and I read
almost every article for the past several years.  I read basically every
article published in the FARMS Review and the Journal of Book of Mormon
Studies and many of the books published by FARMS.  I owned both infobase and
Gospelink libraries and read and researched a ton from those.  I read Answers
to Gospel Questions, Doctrines of Salvation, Mormon Doctrine, Gospel
Symbolism, Great are the Words of Isaiah, Believing Christ, Counseling with
our Councils, both autobiographies of Joseph Fielding Smith, Lion of the Lord
(Brigham Young), David O. McKay's missionary journal, and a whole bunch of
other church books. I've read virtually every book written by Nibley.  I've
studied the Book of Mormon text reformatted according to parallelistic
patterns.  I read Mormon's Codex, John Sorenson's 800+ page magnum opus which
makes a comprehensive case for the parallels between mesoamerica and the Book
of Mormon.

I've given away many dozens of copies of the Book of Mormons, each with my testimony in the
front, to many friends, colleagues, and supervisors.  I was nearly always a
100% home teacher.  I almost always built up a good rapport with each of my
families.  I accepted every calling given to me and magnified it.  I served in
Scouting (mostly as scoutmaster) for the majority of my adult life.  I have
spent many weekends camping away from my family (and usually dragging along
one or more kids because Melissa was sick with another one on the way).  Since
moving to our current location I've spent 2+ hours on most patriotic holidays (~10 per
year) morning and night putting up American flags with the scouts.  Up until
this last December I spent 2-3 hours every Sunday doing finance clerk duties.
I almost always avoided studying on Sunday (like once or twice in my whole
life).  I fasted every fast Sunday and sometimes other days.

I tried to care about and serve the people who were the most down-and-out.  I
would always try to introduce myself to people and sit by whomever looked most
friendless.  I have scars from 24 stitches in my left arm (some put in without
anesthetic and some layers deep) from when I was trying to move a glass table
by myself in the Texas heat for a poor LDS immigrant in the ward (table
slipped on my sweat, shattered, and a giant shard fell into my arm and hand).

Why does my whole life and soul sacrifice not merit some deep discussion of the issues with you?  How can you possibly think I was flawed or weak in my Gospel committment?  Why do you suspect my integrity instead of suspecting the integrity of the foundational truth-claims themselves?

## FODDER

Truman Show: You grow up and live it
Thought about Plato's cave.

Dad always suggests that the Church will eventually correct itself.  To some
extent, the issue is not whether the Church is currently wrong/right but *how*
it teaches members to arrive at conclusions.  If that mechanism is faulty,
then you may continue making sub-optimal decisions your entire life!  In terms
of your life trajectory, *how* you make decisions is one of the most crucial
parts of you.  The Church admits that it has been wrong [blacks and
priesthood], so their method for determining truth is not flawless.  Shouldn't
you examine that method?

"Persecution" (i.e., the fact that people oppose is not necessarily an
indication that the Church is true).  For instance, the a common
characteristic of cults is that [they feel the world is persecuting
them](http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=33164), but that does not mean that
criticism of these groups is unfounded.

# But you just want to tear down--you're a faith-killer

Members are sometimes convinced by leaders that they should not listen to
anything critical of the church because "true" messages will build, not
destroy.

For instance, Elder Asay, in the October 1981 General Conference, recounted a
story of a recent convert who fell away from the Church after listening to an
"apostate" who "cited changes made in Church publications over the years".  He
advised:

> Avoid those who would tear down your faith. Faith-killers are to be shunned. The seeds which they plant in the minds and hearts of men grow like cancer and eat away the Spirit. True messengers of God are builders---not destroyers.

I agree with Elder Asay that certain attitudes and life perspectives can be
corrosive.  I agree that our environment matters and that we ought to,
generally, surround ourselves with people who are constructive, positive, and
morally-minded.  However, some analogies might be useful to show why I do not
necessarily consider those who point out problems or issues in the Church or its
truth-claims to be "destroyers."

The original SLC Temple foundation was built with sandstone, but after the
Utah War it was discovered that some of the stones had cracked.  After cracks
were discovered, should the builders have merely ignored the problems?  What
would have happened had they continued to build on that cracked foundation?
Even though they were pointing out problems and then tearing out stone, should
we label the workers who discovered and removed the broken sandstone
"destroyers"?  Were those concerned with building a solid foundation "temple-killers"?

The opening paragraph of "The Ethics of Belief: The Duty of Inquiry" begins with this analogy:

> A shipowner was about to send to sea an emigrant-ship. He knew that she was old, and not overwell built at the first; that she had seen many seas and climes, and often had needed repairs. Doubts had been suggested to him that possibly she was not seaworthy.  These doubts preyed upon his mind, and made him unhappy; he thought that perhaps he ought to have her thoroughly overhauled and refitted, even though this should put him to great expense. Before the ship sailed, however, he succeeded in overcoming these melancholy reflections. He said to himself that she had gone safely through so many voyages and weathered so many storms that it was idle to suppose she would not come safely home from this trip also. He would put his trust in Providence, which could hardly fail to protect all these unhappy families that were leaving their fatherland to seek for better times elsewhere. He would dismiss from his mind all ungenerous suspicions about the honesty of builders and contractors. In such ways he acquired a sincere and comfortable conviction that his vessel was thoroughly safe and seaworthy; he watched her departure with a light heart, and benevolent wishes for the success of the exiles in their strange new home that was to be...[and] she went down in mid-ocean and told no tales.

Was the shipowner guilty of the deaths of those people?  Did he have a duty to
inspect the ship when others had given him cause for concern?  Had he
inspected the boat and found it to be sound, would his inspection have been
faith destroying or faith-building?  Had he inspected the boat and then
discovered that the boat was unsound and needed repair or replacement, should
we label him a "faith-killer"?

# Afraid of the potential repercussions?

If you are in a cult, then you ought to get outside of it and examine it.  If
you are not in a cult, then why do you fear investigation?  Why do you fear
what your life and friendships and associations might look like if you found
out it wasn't true?

A Jonestown survivor, Deborah Layton, wrote:

> When your own thoughts are forbidden, when your questions are not allowed and our doubts are punished, when contacts with friendships outside of the organization are censored, we are being abused, for the ends never justify the means. When our heart aches knowing we have made friendships and secret attachments that will be forever forbidden if we leave, we are in danger. When we consider staying in a group because we cannot bear the loss, disappointment and sorrow our leaving will cause for ourselves and those we have come to love, we are in a cult... If there is any lesson to be learned it is that an ideal can never be brought about by fear, abuse, and the threat of retribution. When family and friends are used as a weapon in order to force us to stay in an organization, something has gone terribly wrong.

You are the only person that can decide this question.  If you feel like you
can freely investigate and that your friendships and associations transcend
the Church, then what do you have to fear from investigation?  If you fear
what investigating might mean to your friendships and world, perhaps you *ought*
to confront that fear?

Do not fear the unknown, fear ignorance

No. I will lift them up, and in their own way too, if I cannot persuade them my way is better; and I will not seek to compel any man to believe as I do, only by the force of reasoning, for truth will cut its own way.” [source](http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/voice-religious-conscience)

However, the brethren appear to follow the long-standing tradition of never apologizing and never openly contradicting the statement made by a church leader until they are dead.

In addition, the quote was merely changed to "When the prophet speaks the debate is over".  This is currently taught in the Aaronic priesthood manual.
