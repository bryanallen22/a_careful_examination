From [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/729ndt/dear_tbms_turning_on_a_light_switch_does_not/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=multi)

> When TBM friends and family find out that I’m an agnostic they typically approach the topic of faith with the concept of turning on a light bulb and how every time someone goes to flip a switch they are utilizing faith that it’s going to turn on. Well, that is not faith - that’s actually just knowledge of a pattern that works. You know why it’s not faith? Because the moment you flip that switch and the light does NOT come on, your mind immediately begins to problem solve and figure out what’s wrong with the switch, wiring, bulb, etc. Whereas, in the situation of “faith”, if something doesn’t work out, you immediately question YOURSELF and what YOU did wrong. That’s the difference between faith and demonstrable knowledge.
