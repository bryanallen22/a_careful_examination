<h1 class="title">The 6 Sources of Revelation</h1>
</header>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Nearly all humans recognize that some kinds of transcendent
experience open our minds to new ideas and perspectives. While a theist
typically believes that the most important revelation originates from a
divine source, all humans are united in seeking revelation, broadly
defined—all of us value insight into our nature and connectedness with
one another and the universe regardless of our belief in God(s).</p>
<p>Like “love languages,” sources of revelation can be thought of as
“spiritual languages.” Some people may receive more revelation from one
source than another, and perhaps the volume of revelation from different
sources may change over the course of a person’s life. There is probably
value in trying to understand which sources others resonate with most
and occasionally exploring or revisiting sources that we may have
neglected in our spiritual development.</p>
<h2 id="six-sources-of-revelation">Six Sources of Revelation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Personal Revelation</strong>: Personal revelation is
arguably the most important source of revelation, because it emphasizes
personal responsibility for discovery and growth. Benjamin Franklin once
wrote “God helps those who help themselves.” Personal revelation
encourages a person to learn as much as they can and sift through ideas
to find what resonates most with them and what they view as being most
grounded in transcendent goodness.</li>
<li><strong>Teachers</strong>: Life is a very difficult journey for all
of us. Going to those who are personally trusted for guidance often
makes life easier to navigate. Those whom we seek guidance from can have
many different titles and can include family, friends, or spiritual
leaders.</li>
<li><strong>Community</strong>: Talking and serving with others helps us
learn and build connection. Some find community in formal groups
dedicated to spiritual growth. Formal groups create space for sharing
personal revelations, discussing scripture, and performing rituals.
Others may find community in less formal associations (e.g., a group of
close friends with whom spiritual insights are shared).</li>
<li><strong>Scriptures</strong>: Scripture may be viewed as sacred
writing (typically, but not necessarily, from past generations) that
convey valuable lessons or reveal truths about our nature or
inter-connectedness. These writings may be fiction, non-fiction, or
somewhere in between.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>: Tools are often used as a reminder of
something or are used to produce greater understanding. Tools may
include things like jewelry, symbols, clothing, grooming styles, names
or titles, food, or entheogens. Tools may also include places of worship
or reflection such as churches, temples, or being in nature.</li>
<li><strong>Rituals</strong>: Rituals are formalized and/or symbolic
actions that are based in tradition. They often mark a milestone in
life, symbolize a commitment, give advice or comfort, or convey a desire
for things to change. Formal religious rituals might include things such
as prayer, fasting, baptism, or weddings. More secular (but still
sacred) rituals might be graduation ceremonies and memorial
services.</li>
</ol>
<h2
id="typical-sources-for-members-of-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints">Typical
sources for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints</h2>
<p>Latter-day Saints may receive revelation during or through the
following means (not meant to be exhaustive, merely suggestive):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Personal Revelation</strong>: Latter-day Saints view the
most important sources of personal as the Light of Christ, the Gift of
the Holy Ghost, and perhaps for some the Second Comforter (i.e.,
personal visitations from Jesus Christ and maybe even God the
Father).</li>
<li><strong>Teachers</strong>: The First Presidency and Quorum of the
Twelve, other General Authorities, parents, Sunday school and quorum
teachers, quorum and class presidencies, and peers.</li>
<li><strong>Community</strong>: Latter-day Saints belong to a ward that
is itself part of a larger stake, region, and area. Individuals are part
of quorums and classes throughout their lives. Students attend seminary
and institute together. Ministering assignments and other activities
(like basketball or zumba) also create cross class relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Scriptures</strong>: LDS scripture includes at least the
Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of
Great Price. General Conference is viewed as a kind of living scripture
that may update or supersede past scripture or conference with the
expectation that it will always harmonize. Patriarchal blessings and
journals may be viewed as personal scripture.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>: Oil for blessings, conservative business
apparel (especially white shirts), garments, ceremonial temple clothing,
appellations like “brother”, “sister”, “President”, and “Bishop” may be
viewed as tools that call to remembrance or help in the reception of
revelation.</li>
<li><strong>Rituals</strong>: Latter-day Saints engage in fasting,
prayer, blessings on food, annual tithing settlement, baby-blessings,
baptism, setting apart, conferral of priesthood and ordination to
offices. In temples, publicly recognized rituals include washings and
anointings, the endowment, the sealing ceremony, and baptisms for the
dead.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="typical-sources-for-a-secular-humanist">Typical sources for a
secular humanist</h2>
<p>Secular humanists are not tightly grouped as a culture, so any
representation will be vastly inadequate. I will speak from my own
experience as a secular humanist as to sources of revelation for me, but
that is admittedly only one possible instantiation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the major difference between my past time as a devout member
of the LDS faith and my current perspective is that I am much more
<em>eager</em> now to embrace widely different sources for
inspiration/revelation. While I certainly appreciated alternative
perspectives as a member, I put LDS sources on a bit of a pedestal in
how I viewed them as capable of bringing the best or purest forms of
inspiration.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Now, I see deep/inspiration at
almost every turn—I had to stop myself listing examples because I view
most of these lists as having <em>hundreds</em> of diverse influences
within them now.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Personal Revelation</strong>: A secular humanist might view
the process of concious and subconscious engagement with a problem or
theme a source for generating new ideas and sudden strokes of insight.
Understanding new or different models of reality and comparing their
ability to capture and predict data often produces new insights.</li>
<li><strong>Teachers</strong>: Without necessarily fully adopting a
single philosophy, thought-leaders, commentators, or other individuals
across the professional, religious, and political spectrum may
<em>contribute</em> important spiritual insights to my life. For
example, at one point or another I found <em>some</em> inspiration in
the thoughts of:
<ul>
<li>Sam Harris</li>
<li>Jordan Peterson</li>
<li>Ezra Klein</li>
<li>David Brooks</li>
<li><a

Parker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@maklelan">Dan McClellan</a></li>
<li>the Dalai Lama</li>
</ul>
In addition, virtually <em>every</em> individual has some perspective on
life—whether fully verbalized or not—that is probably unique in some
fashion and worthy of reflection and introspection. Everyone is a
teacher in some way.</li>

working towards a common end, and reflecting on life, its challenges,

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>It was natural to view LDS sources as
having the ability to produce better/more revelation since <a
href="https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-9-prophets-of-god?lang=eng">they
teach that</a> “God communicates to the Church through His prophet[s]”
and that they have access to the <em>most</em> truth of any religious
group on earth since they were the recipient of direct revelation and
additional scripture that is not honored by most other religions.<a
