[pre-draft]

Shadrach Ricketson, a physician in New York, published the book "Means of
Preserving Health and Preventing Diseases" in 1806 in New York.

The book includes a recommendation in the front of 8 others. I searched their
names in the context of New York to establish their likely identities:

* Nichs (Nicholas) Romayne: [The First President of the College of Physicians
  and Surgeons, New York City](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1806896/)
*
