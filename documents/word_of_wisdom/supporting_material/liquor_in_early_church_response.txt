Your explanation with the Wikipedia article is generally sound I think (thank you for that).  However, my initial hesitance about accepting this conclusion:

> Yet the pre-Nauvoo history shows that even beer was considered against the WoW when it was first given.

is not supported *at all* by any of Hoskisson's primary sources.  After reading Hoskisson thoroughly--and all the primary sources he references--it is clear that your conclusion is completely unsupported.

Hoskisson adequately demonstrates that the WoW was originally received as more of a covenant than a word of wisdom and was treated basically as it is now (part of being a Saint).  I agree fully with his conclusion:

> Though enforcement certainly was inconsistent, there can be little doubt that the Word of Wisdom as contained in the 1835 Doctrine and Covenants was accepted by the Church in Kirtland as binding on every member, that compliance was expected from every office holder, and that it could be used as a test of good standing.

I also understand how you might come to the conclusion that you did about beer.  Hoskisson uses "total abstinence" and "alcohol" sloppily throughout when he really should be using the term "strong drinks" which are understood to be wine or distilled spirits.  Every primary source he cites (or is cited by those sources he cites) either implies or overtly indicates a demarcation between strong drinks (of various kinds and by differen appelations) and beer (normal or mild).  I don't fault Hoskisson for not making this distinction--it wasn't the distinction he cared about in writing this article (he had a bigger fish to fry and he fried that one very well).

This distinction to the early Saints makes a lot of sense when a person better understands alcoholic drinks. Alcoholic content is fairly different between beer and other drinks:

* beer 2%–12% (usually 4%–6%)
* wine: most often 12.5%–14.5%
* liqueurs: 15%–55%
* whiskey: usually 40%, 43% or 46%

If we assume a 4% alcoholic content for beer, then:

* wine is 3X stronger then beer
* liqueurs are on the magnitude of 8X stronger than beer
* whiskey is about 10X stronger than beer

A 160 pound man drinks one 12-ounce(?) standard beer in on hour, his blood/breath alcohol concentration will be 0.002g/210 Liters of breath.

* 0.02 is the lowest limit of any restriction for any job (safety sensitive transportation job)
* 0.08 is the standard level of intoxication across states

2 beers: 0.025g (still would not receive federally mandated sanction for a safety sensitive job) and could legally drink.  A 160 pound man has to consume 5 standard beers within one hour to exceed the state blood alcohol limit for driving!  That's a lot of beer!

There is also some indication that there was beer and "small beer"[^beer_and_beer], but that isn't even important for this defense.  I will defend standard beer and whatever applies for standard beer goes even moreso for "small beer".

[^beer_and_beer]: http://timesandseasons.org/index.php/2004/09/barley-for-mild-drinks/ (referencing a now defunct website by an exmormon) there were two barley drinks at the time of the Word of Wisdom, “beer” and “small beer.” Beer had 5% alcohol and small beer had 1% alcohol.

Why was beer likely not a prohibition of the Word of Wisdom?

1. Well, the Word of Wisdom explicitly allows for it: "... and barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks ...".
2.  In every primary account I looked at in Hoskosson's work or those he referenced, it is clear that the early Saints are referring to "strong drinks" of one sort or another (wine, brandy, or whiskey) and **never--not even once**-- beer.

Regardless, I did uncover this gem as I was turning pages.  It's not really relevent to the beer discussion, but it did prove that JS considered drinking alcohol because you were depressed a legitimate behavior to some degree (I personally do not condone that behavior, however):

> Sometime after dinner we sent for some wine. It has been reported by some that this was taken as a sacrament. It was no such thing; our spirits were generally dull and heavy, and it was sent for to revive us. I think it was Captain Jones who went after it, but they would not suffer him to return. I believe we all drank of the wine, and gave some to one or two of the prison guards. We all of us felt unusually dull and languid, with a remarkable depression of spirits. In consonance with those feelings I sang a song, that had lately been introduced into Nauvoo, entitled, 'A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief', etc. (John Taylor History of the Church vol 7, pg 101)

Drinking to intoxication would be viewed as against the WoW, but that is somewhat difficult to do with standard beer and virtually impossible to do with 1% (mild beers).  Again, amongst all the primary sources I looked at, there is never an indication that someone had drunk to intoxication with beer.

Here's how FAIR discusses beer (http://en.fairmormon.org/Word_of_Wisdom/History_and_implementation):

> Beer, unfermented or lightly fermented wine, and cider were considered "mild drinks" (D&C 89:17) and therefore acceptable (note that verse 17 specifically permits "barley...for mild drinks")

> A strict ban of all alcohol in Joseph Smith's time would have been a death sentence for many Latter-day Saints—especially during the 1832–1833 cholera pandemic, which spread its disease by water.

In a comment(s) below I've included every quote from Hoskisson's article that might have any bearing on this point.  I've also included everything from any source he references that might have any bearing on the topic.  I apologize if the formatting is bad (was copying from pdf) and I'm not going to correct it, but this way you can easily search for any quote you want:

> In short, the Word of Wisdom is seen as a wise recommendation that gained authoritative weight as time went on. Leonard Arrington sums up this view: “Taking the 1830s and 1840s as a whole . . . there is considerable evidence that many Mormon leaders and members believed that the Word of Wisdom meant only a piece of good advice and nothing more.”3****Thomas G. Alexander agrees: “Some members or groups committed themselves to strict adherence to the Word of Wisdom, but they were doing so as individuals.”4+ As the traditional telling of the story continues, only after the Nauvoo period were the first attempts made to require compliance. Candidates for requiring strict adherence are, most popularly, Brigham Young, Joseph F.  Smith, and Heber J. Grant.5+

> "strongly suggest that, in the first seven to eight years following the revelation of the Word of Wisdom, the official standard of the Church was one of strict abstinence that would be familiar to Saints today"

> "abstinence from tea, coffee, tobacco, and alcohol was made a test of worthiness to hold an office and to be a member in good standing"

> three hypotheses about why in Nauvoo “the somewhat strict prohibitions of the 1830s regarding the use of alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee among the Mormons [eroded] away, as moderation rather than abstinence became the major concern.”

> with the most severe reprimands being reserved for those guilty of public intoxication and illegal activities.

> the proclaimed standard for everyone, both in official pronouncements and in the criteria used in disciplinary instances, was abstinence.

> On the basis of this instruction, Latter-day Saints were certainly justified in using wine for the sacrament even after receiving the Word of Wisdom on February 27, 1833.

> “The sacrament was administered on every first day, (Sabbath), by a high priest or an elder. Bread and wine are used as emblems, but for wine they prefer the pure juice of the grape when they can get it.”

> Arrington has claimed that in December 1836 “the church congregation voted a pledge of total abstinence from intoxicants after which water was used in the Lord’s Supper.”12

> Arrington cites Matthias F. Cowley for his source, but the Cowley passage, a paraphrase of Wilford Woodruff’s journal, does not mention water at all.13


>> Arrington (ref12):
>> the church council in kirtland in february 1834 for example adopted the following resolution no official member in this church is worthy to hold an office after having the word of wisdom properly taught him and he the official member neglecting to comply with it or obey it 4 in december 1836 the church congregation voted a pledge of total abstinence from intoxicants after which water was used in the lord s supper 5 at a general meeting conducted by church authorities in far west missouri in 1837 the membership agreed that we will not fellowship any ordained member who will not or does not observe the word of wisdom according to its literal reading 6 several months later at the annual conference of the church joseph smith spoke on the word of wisdom and stated that it should be observed 7 moreover when a council at far west tried a high church official david whitmer for his fellowship the first of the five charges against him was that he did not observe the word of wisdom 8


>>> ref4: The spiritual manifestations of those times in Kirtland brought with them heartfelt desires to observe every rule of correct living. That spirit was not at all in harmony with the use of intoxicating liquors; and whatever became an obstacle to the spirit of worship must be removed if the worship were to be enjoyed. It was important that the use of liquor should be dis- continued, and Elder Woodruff records in his journal that on the 4th day of December, that year, Sidney Rigdon called for a vote of the people on the discontinuance of the use of liquor in the Church both in sickness and in health. An exception to the rule was made in the case of the washing of the bodies; and under proper regulations, wine might be used for the Sacrament. The vote was unanimous.

>>> ref5: The president opened the Council by prayer.  At a church meeting, held in Pennsylvania, Erie county, and Springfield township, by Orson Pratt and Lyman E. Johnson, High Priests, some of the members of that church refused to partake of the Sacrament, because the Elder administering it did not observe the Word of Wisdom to obey it. Elder Johnson argued that they were justified in so doing, because the Elder was in transgression. Elder Pratt argued that the church was bound to receive the Supper under the administration of an Elder, so long as he retained his office or license. Voted that six Councilors should speak upon the subject.  The Council then proceeded to try the question, whether disobedience to the Word of Wisdom was a transgression sufficient to deprive an official member from holding office in the Church, after having it sufficiently taught him.  Councilors Samuel H. Smith, Luke S. Johnson, John S. Carter, Sylvester Smith, John Johnson and Orson Hyde, were called to speak upon the case then before the Council. After the Councilors had spoken, the President proceeded to give the decision: No official member in this Church is worthy to hold an office, after having the Word of Wisdom properly taught him, and he, the official member, neglecting to comply with or obey it; which decision the Council confirmed by vote.

>>> ref6: Resolved unanimously, that we will not fellowship any ordained member who will not, or does not, observe the Word of Wisdom according to its literal reading.

>>> ref7: behind paywalls, cannot get source, but we can infer from the citation that this would not further clarify the beer question.

>>> ref8: (pulled from https://byustudies.byu.edu/hc/3/3.html)

>>> April 13.—The following charges were preferred against David Whitmer, before the High Council at Far West, in council assembled.

>>> First—For not observing the Word of Wisdom.

[ref13 is Arrington's ref4, shown below]

> “wine at the Sacraments” was an authorized exception to total abstinence from alcohol.14

>> (pulled from http://www.ristow.us/foswiki/pub/Genealogy/WilfordWoodruffsJournalKrautsPioneerPress/Woodruff_Wilfords_Journal_-_Krauts_Pioneer_Press.pdf) Dec. 4, 1836: Sunday I went up to the house of the Lord to worship. Elder Parish preached in the forepart of the day. Several spoke in the latter part of the day. President Rigdon called a vote of the Church to discountenance the use entirely of all liquors from the Church in sickness and in health except wine at the Sacraments and for external washing. The vote was carried unanimously.

> Thus, the choice of water or wine in the nineteenth century seems to have depended more on the availability of wine produced by Latter-day Saints than on any perceived restrictions based on the Word of Wisdom.

> What this means is that, during Joseph Smith’s lifetime, using wine or another alcoholic beverage during any solemn occasion cannot be viewed a priori as violating the Word of Wisdom.

> Thus, it is clear that the Kirtland Saints were sanctioned in making an exception to total abstinence by the Word of Wisdom itself.  Wine was acceptable for solemn occasions, especially for the Lord’s Supper

> Joseph Smith noted: "In the discussion of the foregoing bill, I spoke at great length on the use of liquors, and showed that they were unnecessary, and operate as a poison in the stomach, and that roots and herbs can be found to effect all necessary purposes."

> It should not, however, be assumed that by “liquors” Joseph Smith meant only distilled alcohol (although in this case he probably did). While the modern definition of “liquor” normally means “an alcoholic beverage made by distillation rather than by fermentation,”30++ this has not always been the case. Historically, “liquor” has traditionally included “liquid for drinking; beverage, drink,” and specifically, “a drink produced by fermentation or distillation,” including “ale, beer, porter, etc.”

> ” On the other hand, “spirituous liquor” meant a “liquor produced by distillation.”31++When Joseph specifically meant fermented drinks, he called them “vinous liquors.”32

> Therefore, though the Nauvoo city ordinance in question seems to have been aimed at distilled drinks (“whiskey” and “spirituous liquors”), when it is used without qualification, it could mean either distilled or fermented drinks.

> In fact, Church records and members’ journals from the Kirtland and Missouri period seem to reflect an understanding in the Church that the medicinal use of coffee, tea, and alcohol (but not tobacco) was acceptable.33

> ref33: According to Peterson, “An Historical Analysis of the Word of Wisdom,” 23–24, “While the Saints opposed the common use of tea and coffee, it would appear that they had little objection to its occasional use for medicinal purposes. . . . While the general use of whiskey and liquor was contrary to the principle, many Saints felt these beverages had redeeming medicinal qualities.

> “I have no objection to our keeping things in our possession that are necessary for sickness, but let the whisky and the tobacco be put to their legitimate uses, then all will be right.”

> Six years later, on April 7, 1867, speaking in the same location, Wilford Woodruff said it even more clearly: “Lay aside whisky, tobacco, tea, and coffee, and use none of them unless it be as a medicine.”35****In Salt Lake City at a meeting of the “School of the Prophets” on November 11, 1872, Brigham Young stated that “the Word of Wisdom consists in taking that which his [Young’s] system required when it is needed,” the example being, “if he were to feel as tired when he got home as when he came here [presumably the School of the Prophets], and he were to take a brandy sling, the Lord would bless it to him.”

> ”Wells added that he himself had been given “a strong drink of Brandy” when he had been injured by a fall with the result that he “experienced no ill effects” from the fall. “This was medicine.”36+

[note, brandy is produced by distilling wine]

> some members continued to excuse their use of alcohol for medicinal purposes well into the second half of the twentieth century.

> At a gathering of the members of the Church on September 7, 1851, it was resolved that the Saints would “leave off using tea, coffee, tobacco, snuff, and whiskey.”

> “I tell you one thing if we obey the word of the L[or]d got to quit drinking whiskey tea coffee tobacco.”  Therefore, rather than seeing the 1851 resolution as the first fitful effort to begin enforcing the Word of Wisdom, it should be seen as a return to the Kirtland position of strict abstinence and to a plain reading of the revelation, even if these post-Nauvoo resolutions did not seem to stick.

> . Except for sacramental wine and the medicinal exception for prohibited substances, the official position of Church authorities in Ohio called for adherence to the Word of Wisdom at the same level required today—that is, to hold an office or to be a member in good standing required strict abstinence from tea, coffee, alcohol, and tobacco.

> John Murdock recorded in his journal on March 4, 1834, that a disciplinary council convened in Kirtland at the home of a member named Orton in order to consider the case of another Church member. Witnesses testified that the member “waked (sic) disorderly & made too free a use of Strong drink. And the church lifted their hands against him & he was disfellowshiped.”58 Though “too free a use” could indicate that this member’s drinking might have been tolerated if he had exercised more control, the fact that he was disfellowshipped (almost the equivalent of excommunication in this case) is another indication of how seriously the Word of Wisdom was being taken.

> He admitted that he had a “propensity for talebearing, and drinking strong drink, but denied the other charges.”

> of being unfaithful, as he claimed, means he was excommunicated for “tale-bearing” and drinking alcohol.

(my note: really, for drinking strong drink, not alcohol as Hoskisson is laying on an interpretation)

> "We speak definitely and pointedly on this subject, because we feel the weight and importance of it. If, as the Lord has said, strong drinks are not to be taken internally, can those who use them thus be held guiltless? We ask, if hot drinks are not to be used, if those who make use of them do not transgress his commands, or at least set at nought his counsel?" [1837]

> In a move that would be repeated in Missouri a month later, the Kirtland High Council voted on October 23, 1837, to “discountenance the use of ardent spirits in any way to sell or to be brought into this place for sale or use.” They also “appointed Luke S. Johnson, Reynolds Cahoon, and John Gould a committee to visit John Johnson, Jun., and see if he would desist from selling spirituous liquors to those who were in the habit of getting intoxicated, and report to the authorities of the Church those members who might drink spirits at his house.”72* If the Word of Wisdom were not viewed as binding on the members, there would have been little reason for the Kirtland High Council to pursue this course, especially in asking for the names of Church members who were violating the Word of Wisdom’s prohibition against alcohol.

[Again, note that Hoskisson is not adequately distinguishing between 'alcohol' and mild drinks.]

> This exodus became known as “Kirtland Camp.” Article 2 of the constitution states that the “tentmen” who were appointed to take charge of each tent during the journey “shall see that cleanliness, and decency, are observed in all cases, the [comm]andments kept; and the word of wisdom heeded, that is, no tobacco, tea, coffee, snuff, [nor] ardent spir-its, of any kind taken internally.” [new paragraph] This wording stressing total abstinence... This declaration should also remove any doubts that abstinence was the standard.

[again, 'total abstinence' is dealing with ardent spirits (those obtained after repeated distillation)]

>> "I always used some strong drink, and tea and coffee. I knew that God had spoken and condemned the use of these things, and, being determined to live by every word that proceeded from His mouth, I laid them all aside, and have not used them since."

> . Before the summer of 1834 while they were still in New York State, she and John heard the Word of Wisdom preached and promptly “discarded the use of tea, coffee, and spirituous liquors, he [John] being strenuous in observing all the laws of the Church.”

> As far as I can determine, this report from Connecticut is the first Church record to mention the Word of Wisdom’s health benefits, even though much of the general health literature of the day extolled the health benefits of moderate use of or abstinence from coffee, tea, tobacco, and alcohol. *

[again, note that Hoskisson isn't using the word 'alcohol' carefully]

> Six months later, the selling of these prohibited substances again became an issue. In a meeting in Far West on November 7, 1837, attended by Joseph Smith, “the congregation, after a few remarks from Sidney Rigdon, unanimously voted not to support Stores and Shops selling spirituous liquors, Tea, Coffee or Tobacco.”

> “We discountenance the use of ardent spirits in any way to sell or to be brought into this place for sale or use.”

> Lyman was accused among other charges, of “not observing the word of wisdom,” specifically drinking tea, coffee, and brandy.

> referencing Petersen

>> although a trend toward a less rigid application of the word of wisdom was readily observable at least with regard to the portion dealing with alcoholic beverages some continued to hold to a more strict interpretation nterpretation at a meeting held on april 10 1843 1843p several prospective missionaries were ordained elders with this express injunction that they quit the use of 48 tobacco and keep the word of wisdom in november 1844 the saints at lacrosse voted to abstain from the 49 common use of tobacco and all spirituous liquors two months later a bishop hale encouraged some of the male church members to keep the word of wisdom as much as possible in march of 1845 mormon branches at waynesville and alquina quina acquina Al iowa agreed to keep the word of wisdom 51.  while nauvoo obviously relaxed its laws control ling liquor it should not be supposed that mormon society as a whole drank excessively as apparently was the case in most river towns the hancock earie eagle earlo a nonmormon non publication mormon in 1846 lamented the fact that ardent spirits 52 were so difficult to procure another nonmormon non observer mormon expressed astonishment at not seeing loungers KO about the streets nor any drunkards about the taverns by 1846 then the somewhat strict prohibitions of the 1830 regarding the use of alcohol tobacco tea and coffee among the mormons had begun to erode away as moderation rather than abstinence became the major concern still mormons as a whoiel were more temperate than contemporary frontier frontler i society.

We all of us felt unusually dull and languid, with a remarkable depression of spirits.

>>  Joseph Smith: "it was reported to me that some of the brethren had been drinking whiskey that day in violation of the word vor of wisdom I1 called the brethren in and investigated the case and was satisfied that no evil had been done and gave them a couple of dollars with directions to replenish the bottle to stimulate them in the fatigues of their sleepless journeurney journey"59

>>> benjamin F johnson who personally knew joseph As a companion socially he was highly endowed was kind generous mirth loving and at times even convivial he was partial to a well supplied table and he did not always refuse the wine that makethb the heart glad

> Some accommodations were made to contemporary American standards, including the availability of alcoholic beverages

[note that reading Petersen directly one does not find any indication that this was a relaxation against drinking beer]

> ...of spending "a good share of their time in idleness, . . . in squandering a portion of their time at public places, where poison is dealt to the unwary, and those of intemperate habits; and perhaps they occasionally, yea, we fear, too often partake of the baneful cup: notwithstanding it is in direct opposition to the word of the Lord, given in the word of wisdom.  . . . If this was the only act of intemperence [sic] which has come under our observation, we should have been content to let the subject pass, for the present, . . . but as there are other evil practices which are calculated to retard the progress of the saint, in his spiritual walk, we feel it our duty to give them a brief notice at this time; such as the use of tobacco and other intoxicating nauseates, which tend to destroy the influence of the Holy Spirit, as it dwells not in unholy temples, but is an inmate of the bosom of those who live by every word which poceeds [sic] from the mouth of God." This 1840 passage focuses only on alcohol and tobacco as violations of the Word of Wisdom.

[Again, Hoskisson uses 'alcohol' too loosely.]

> Six months later, the city council took steps to make Nauvoo a “dry town” by passing an ordinance on February 15, 1841.134++The ordinance prohibited “vending whiskey in a less quantity than a gallon, or other spirituous liquors in a less quantity than a quart, to any person whatever, excepting on the recommendation of a physician, duly accredited in writing.” ++In modern terms, this ordinance forbade the sale of distilled alcohol by the drink unless prescribed by a doctor, thus leaving open-ended the question of selling larger amounts of distilled alcohol and of fermented drinks in any quantity. Nevertheless, the ordinance is reminiscent of similar prohibitions against producing, selling, and imbibing alcohol that had been instituted in Kirtland and Far West.

> The question of fermented drinks was resolved later that year.  On July 12, 1841, Joseph Smith proposed to the city council “that any person in the City of Nauvoo be at liberty to sell vinous liquors in any quantity, subject to the city ordinances.”


> “Inasmuch, as the use of ardent spirits is prohibited by the gospel, and is not conducive to the happiness, peace and well being of society; therefore, Resolved, 1st. That this conference [district of the Church] utterly discountenance the use of ardent spirits as a beverage. 2nd. Resolved, That this conference disfellowship every member who continues to indulge, and will not forsake such evil practices.  3rd. Resolved, That this conference, collectively and individually, covenant to keep all the known commandments of God, as made known in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and book of Doctrine and Covenants.”139****Thus, as far as “strong drinks” are concerned, this branch was adhering to the Kirtland standard, even calling for disfellowshipping members who imbibed substances “prohibited by the gospel.”

> “This church will not fellowship any person or persons who are in the habit of drinking ardent spirits, or keeping tipling [tippling] shops, and we will use our best endeavors to suppress it.”

> "And there was no harm in meeting together and drinking ardent spirits and having a Spree now and then and Shivereeing our neighbor upon wedding occasions to make them hand over the grog and good things." Johnson was quite upset by this behavior, especially because the offenders were his first counselor, four members of the stake high council, and the bishop in Ramus. After these men had made a public spectacle of themselves by being intoxicated at a muster of the Nauvoo Legion, Johnson took action...

> *It could mean that the repeal applied to licensing in general, or it could mean that the February 15, 1841, ordinance on dispensing distilled liquors was repealed. Because an ordinance specifically allowing liquor by the drink was passed late in 1843 (see below), I conclude that this 1842 change affected only general licensing and not the ban on liquor by the drink.

> While some Church units continued to be concerned with keeping the Word of Wisdom, in whatever manner they understood “keeping it,” civic life continued a liberalizing trend, particularly where moderate consumption of alcohol was concerned. On March 10, 1843, Joseph Smith, acting in his office as the city’s mayor, told a faithful member of the Church, Theodore Turley, that he “had no objection to his building a brewery” in Nauvoo.154***Turley must have been industrious because within a year he was advertising the sale of “Ale, Beer, and Yeast of the best quality.”

[notice that the "liberalizing trend" is Hoskissons own interpretation, but there is zero evidence that beer was prohibited in the first place!]

> *The ordinance passed in July 1841 allowing the sale of “vinous liquors” in any amount would no doubt have covered the sale of fermented grains, in addition to wines.

[But just because the allowance of vinous liquors would likely also allow for fermented grains like beer, the passing of this ordinance with its particular wording is good indication that the brewery was *already* considered kosher]

> Regardless of ecclesiastical efforts, Nauvoo’s civil laws tended toward greater relaxation. In December 1843, the city council passed an ordinance “that the Mayor of the city [Joseph Smith] be and is hereby authorized to sell or give spirits of any quantity as he in his wisdom shall judge to be for the health and comfort, or convenience of such travelers or other persons as shall visit his house from time to time.”160* The trumping of the previous ban on liquor by the drink, at the very least an accommodation to non-Latter-day Saints but perhaps also indicative of changing attitudes in the Church, is not the only point of interest in this ordinance. “Health” is cited along with “comfort” and “convenience” as reasons for dispensing alcohol. The medicinal exemption would become one of the major reasons, I believe, for the relaxation of Word of Wisdom standards in Nauvoo.

> I am not aware of examples of the Prophet violating the Word of Wisdom at any time during the Kirtland period, given the general exceptions mentioned above for health reasons and for solemn/sacramental occasions.

> [Joseph Smith speaking] ...What many people call sin is not sin; I do many things to break down superstition, and I will break it down;” I referred to the curse of Ham for laughing at Noah, while in his wine, but doing no harm. Noah was a righteous man, and yet he drank wine and became intoxicated; the Lord did not forsake him in consequence thereof, for he retained all the power of his priesthood..."

> . A similar point could be made regarding the consumption of strong drinks. While the general use of whiskey and liquor was contrary to the principle, many Saints felt these beverages had redeeming medicinal qualities.”

>  Some of the non-Latter-day-Saint temperance movements that predate the Word of Wisdom allowed similar use of these substances for health reasons. For example, Hosea Stout, who had joined a Protestant temperance movement in 1830 before he joined the Church, recalled in the later 1840s that “the temperance regulations allowed a man to use ardent spirits as medicine.”

> Church records also show that in June 1834 when cholera struck Zion’s Camp in Missouri, a whiskey and flour mixture was prescribed as a cure.

> On December 4, 1836, during a meeting of the Saints in the House of the Lord in Kirtland, Sidney Rigdon called for a vote “to discountenance the use intirely of all liquors from the Church in Sickness & in health except wine at the Sacraments & for external Washing.  The vote was Carried eunanimously.”174++This resolution was an attempt to close the medicinal loophole while allowing the same use of wine for the sacrament that the Word of Wisdom itself permits.

> In Kirtland, all official pronouncements required strict abstinence for a member to remain in good standing and to hold an office.
