First, a little intro to bring the reader up-to-speed on tea.  Tea comes from steeping parts of _Camellia sinensis_ in hot or boiled water.  Depending on the level of oxidation of the tea leaves, you get different types of tea: white, oolong, green, and black tea.  Herbal teas are made in the same way, but not using the Camellia sinensis plant.  So, a "true" tea is any tea made from _Camellia sinensis_.  A lot of health studies focus on green tea (common healthier tea), and some on black tea (most common tea).  But just to be clear, green tea is *real* tea.
