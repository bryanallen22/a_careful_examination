It appears that _any_ rationale that may be given for why tea and coffee are forbidden but other drinks are not---besides that God commanded it to be that way---cannot be sustained logically:

* Caffeinated sodas are OK, but coffee and tea are forbidden because D&C 89 forbids "hot drinks."  It's not about caffeine.
* Hot chocolate is OK, despite being hot, because "hot drinks" really means brewed drinks.
* Iced tea and iced coffee are forbidden, despite being cold, because they are brewed.
* But herbal teas, hot or iced, are OK, despite being brewed, because there is no caffeine.
