# The 3 "modules" of marriage

There are three "modules" related to traditional heterosexual marriage:

* committed companionship
* parenting
* sexual reproduction

Traditional marriage is great because it fosters an environment where sexual reproduction is tied to a committed companionship and also to parenting.  I think Mormons have a valid point with this one.  **However**, enacting legislation that *specifically* ties sexual reproduction, parenting, and committed companionship together is extremely difficult.

The government has an interest in supporting parents in their child-rearing duties regardless of the other two modules.  This is why we support both single mothers and adoptive couples---it makes sense to support *any* parent / legal guardian.

Virtually all of our legislation regarding marriage over the past 50 years has focused on committed companionship and parenting.  The state has virtually ignored the sexual reproduction module in how it interacts with marriage.  If you look at the rulings it is clear that judges looked careful at the parenting aspect.  Homosexual marriage fulfills the goals of the state because where homosexual couples intend to raise children, a committed two partner home is far superior to a single home.  Basically, marriage between homosexuals has been deemed *close enough* in the eyes of the state.  Given how the state *already* treats marriage, it is unequal treatment of homosexuals to deny them participation in the institution.

## Appendix

Some thoughts obliquely related to the LDS position on same-sex marriage.

### The preamble to the Constitution

The Preamble to the Constitution explains when/how/why a government may act in behalf of its constituents:

> We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

The key issues with marriage are probably:

* promote the general welfare
* insure domestic tranquility

### The word 'marriage'

Although we like to think of the word "marriage" in a lofty, idyllic sense, the fact is that [God has condoned a wide variety of couplings in the past](http://images.elephantjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/marriage.jpg).

### Scriptural condemnation of homosexual marriage

The New Testament Jesus himself never condemned homosexual marriage.  The Old Testament condemns homosexuality, but it condemns so much that it does feel like cherry-picking to focus *only* on the things that happen to agree with our current view of morality.  Incidentally, some fundamentalist Christians actually *do* keep the other strange prohibitions in the Old Testament or New Testament.  For instance, many fundamentalist churches prohibit women form speaking, and my cousin-in-law's father, in Georgia, used to keep the Old Testament prohibitions.  Those who cherry-pick some Old Testament teachings and not others have the burden of explaining why so don't let Mormons weasel out by saying that the other ones are impractical or out-dated.

It seems to me that if a group or individual is interested in Old Testament (or even New Testament) prohibitions, then they need some coherent reason for selecting some and not others.  Latter-day Saints might argue "modern day revelation", but I'm not aware of any modern day revelation having been received on the topic (note that [the family proclamation should probably not be viewed as revelation](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/7c67d2029f5b38669069b9af5d4f1305df2a2c51/documents/family-proclamation/family_proclamation_not_scripture_a_legal_document.pdf))

### God may not have destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for homosexuality

Every time Sodom and Gomorrah is referenced God is condemning something else--not homosexuality!  See [this rational faiths article](http://rationalfaiths.com/old-testament-prohibit-homosexuality/).

### Latter-day Saints used to condemn monogamy with vehemence

See the many quotes by Brigham Young and Orson Pratt in [this article](http://rationalfaiths.com/why-god-allowed-gays-to-marry/).
