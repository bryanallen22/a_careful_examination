This is a place to note the ways in which believing members sometimes feel (or are) judged by former members.


## Catch-22 in responding to arguments

> Another way of phrasing my frustration is this - you're setting up one of the oldest catch-22s in the antimormon playbook. If we don't respond to your CES Letters and your Godmakers and your whatever it is, it's because we have no answers. If we do take the trouble of responding to your claims, we've changed the narrative and gone on the defensive - in Bill Reel's words, we've "given up a lot of ground". It's unfair and more than a little obnoxious.
