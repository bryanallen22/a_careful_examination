# The Shunning Key: How Mormons accept *all* and still shun former members

## Introduction

The leaders and manuals of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints frequently emphasize [brotherly love](https://www.lds.org/search?lang=eng&query=%22brotherly+love%22) and [charity to all](https://www.lds.org/search?lang=eng&query=%22charity+for+all%22).  Consider this statement by Elder M. Russell Ballard:

> Let us reach out in friendship and love to our neighbors, **including those of other faiths**, thus helping to build better family-to-family relationships and greater harmony in our neighborhoods. Remember, too often our behavior is a bigger deterrent to others than is our doctrine. In the spirit of love for **all** men, women, and children, **help them to understand and to feel accepted and appreciated**. (emphasis added) [source](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1999/10/beware-of-false-prophets-and-false-teachers?lang=eng)

Taken at face value, this statement is incredibly inclusive and loving.  Yet many former members describe the loss of close friendships and association with believing members once they leave or question the Church's truth-claims.[^examplesofshunning]

In a [recent panel discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezjGfdeZG4g) an atheist who had heard *many* stories of atheists and homosexuals being kicked out of their LDS homes (which is certainly the extreme of what most experience) asked if there was any doctrinal justification for this behavior (the discussion on shunning begins at about 17:30):

> [Atheist] Are you three saying to me that there is nothing in Mormonism that produces shunning?

> [BYU Professor 1] In my faith, there is nothing that I have been taught or that I teach that says that we should shun...It's not a Mormon ideal to shun

> [BYU Professor 2] There is nothing in Mormonism that would condone the type of behavior you are talking about.

In light of these denials, is it really possible that Mormons shun?[^shundefinition]  And how is it possible in the face of so many inclusive and loving messages such as the one given by Elder Ballard?

## The Shunning Key

The key to understanding most[^othershunning] shunning in the LDS Church is to realize that Latter-day Saints would typically never shun someone who merely left the Church or became less-active---these are people members will often reach out to.  And official Latter-day Saint material is rich in examples of members reaching out to less actives or those who had merely strayed (for [example](https://www.lds.org/ensign/2016/02/when-a-child-leaves-the-church?lang=eng)).

However, while "former members" or "less-actives" are not typically shunned, there are some categories of individuals who members *are* explicitly taught to avoid: **false prophets**, **false teachers** (used synonymously with the terms "deceivers" and "antichrists"[^synonymous]), and **faith-killers** ("apostate" is a term sometimes used-synonymously with faith-killers).  These terms sound almost terrifying---they *must* be a rare exception, right?  Who are these false prophets, false teachers, and faith-killers?

### Flee from False Teachers and False Prophets

M. Russell Ballard taught that [false prophets and false teachers are those who](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1999/10/beware-of-false-prophets-and-false-teachers?lang=eng) (with minor wording changes to make a list): 

1. declare that the Prophet Joseph Smith was a duplicitous deceiver
2. challenge the First Vision as an authentic experience
3. declare that the Book of Mormon and other canonical works are not ancient records of scripture
4. attempt to redefine the nature of the Godhead
5. deny that God has given and continues to give revelation today to His ordained and sustained prophets
6. arrogantly attempt to fashion new interpretations of the scriptures to demonstrate that these sacred texts should not be read as God’s words to His children but merely as the utterances of uninspired men, limited by their own prejudices and cultural biases
7. argue that the scriptures require new interpretation
8. deny Christ’s Resurrection and Atonement, arguing that no God can save us
9. reject the need for a Savior
10. attempt to reinterpret the doctrines of the Church to fit their own preconceived views, and in the process deny Christ and His messianic role
11. those who attempt to change the God-given and scripturally based doctrines that protect the sanctity of marriage, the divine nature of the family, and the essential doctrine of personal morality
12. advocate a redefinition of morality to justify fornication, adultery, and homosexual relationships
13. openly champion the legalization of so-called same-gender marriages
14. To justify their rejection of God’s immutable laws that protect the family, [they] even attack the inspired proclamation on the family issued to the world in 1995 by the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles

He goes on to warn:

> Our safety, our peace, lies in ... **fleeing from false prophets and false teachers**...[^tofleeistoshun]

### Shun Faith-killers

In his 1981 talk [Opposition to the Work of God](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1981/10/opposition-to-the-work-of-god?lang=eng), Carlos E. Asay instructed members[^taughtinmanuals]:

> Avoid those who would teardown your faith. **Faith-killers are to be shunned**. The seeds which they plant in the minds and hearts of men grow like cancer and eat away the Spirit. (emphasis added)

Asay doesn't provide a simple list like Ballard, but we can walk through his talk to determine the characteristics of those he labels "faith-killers".  According to his talk, a faith-killer is one who fits one or more of the following criteria (I've extracted the essence of his words to generate this list):

1. uses personal contacts, the printed word, electronic media, and other means of communication to sow doubts and to disturb the peace of true believers
2. cites changes made in Church publications over the years [to discredit Joseph Smith and subsequent prophets]
3. does not believe in the New Testament because of discrepancies in it
4. does not believe in modern prophets and continuous revelation
5. pins their hopes for salvation upon things other than those related to living prophets and living faith

What constitutes a "faith-killer" is driven home in Asay's discussion of "a very dedicated apostate" towards the beginning of his address.  This "dedicated apostate" did two things: "to discredit Joseph Smith and subsequent prophets, the apostate cited changes made in Church publications over the years" and the apostate pointed out this information to a recent convert.

### The Shunning Key

A [recent survey](http://www.whymormonsquestion.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Survey-Results_Understanding-Mormon-Disbelief-Mar20121.pdf) was conducted on former members to better understand why they left the Church.  The top 5 reasons given were:

* I ceased to believe in the church's doctrine/theology (74%)
* I studied church history and lost my belief (70%)
* I lost faith in Joseph Smith (70%)
* I lost faith in the Book of Mormon (65%)
* I lost confidence in the general authorities (50%)

The majority of Mormons who leave do so *because* they do not believe in the core truth-claims of the Church anymore.  In addition, the majority of those who disbelieve (53%) now consider themselves Agnostic, Atheist, or Humanist.

Hence a typical former mormon, if they ever openly discuss their rationale for doubting the Church's truth-claims or write anything online, will *easily* qualify as a false prophet or false teacher.  At a minimum, they will likely be a tight fit for Ballard's criteria #2, #3, #5, #8, #9,  and they will likely meet *all* of Asay's list characterizing a faith-killer.

Hence, those who leave the Church because they grow tired of living the lifestyle ("lazy") or who would rather live a different lifestyle ("wanting to sin") are likely to be reached out to and fellowshipped, at least to a degree.  Those who left because they investigated the truth-claims and decided the truth-claims are not sustainable are likely to be classified---at least effectually---as "false prophets", "false teachers", or "faith-killers".  Those who are willing and able to share *why* they think the Church truth-claims do not hold up, *ought* to be shunned---according to Ballard and Asay---and these constitute the *majority* of those who leave the LDS Church.

## Conclusion---The Shunning Sleight of Hand

The quote from the introduction was actually from Elder Ballard's talk on false prophets and false teachers (I will reproduce it here):

> Let us reach out in friendship and love to our neighbors, **including those of other faiths**, thus helping to build better family-to-family relationships and greater harmony in our neighborhoods. Remember, too often our behavior is a bigger deterrent to others than is our doctrine. In the spirit of love for **all** men, women, and children, **help them to understand and to feel accepted and appreciated**. (emphasis added) [source](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1999/10/beware-of-false-prophets-and-false-teachers?lang=eng)

The statement *sounds* incredibly inclusive.  However, Ballard's entire talk was focused on *deciding* who is a false prophet or false teacher.  With a rubric in hand that fits the majority (but not all) of those who leave the Church, Ballard concludes his talk:

> Our safety, our peace, lies in working as hard as we can to live as the Father and Son would have us live, **in fleeing from false prophets and false teachers**, and in being anxiously engaged in good causes.

As far as I can tell, this pattern is strictly followed in all LDS material.  I am not aware of a single instance in Church produced material when someone who openly discusses their rationale for rejecting Church truth-claims is reached out to for fellowship (much less engaged with in substantive discussion).  Members are always taught to avoid these kinds of former members.  And, in official Church material, all former members who are fellowshipped either have no intellectual justification for leaving or are completely silent about their rationale.

[^shundefinition]: To "shun" means, according to Merriam-Webster, "to avoid deliberately and especially habitually".  The most extreme examples of shunning come from some religious communities (Amish, Jehovahs Witnesses) who *formally* avoid speaking with those who have left the faith.  Besides excommunication and disfellowshipment (which are far more mild than the formal shunning in these other faiths) Mormons do not *formally* shun anyone.  *General avoidance* and the avoidance of talking about truth-claim issues and/or a person's new beliefs is how I am using the word "shun" in this document.  The usage seems justified given how Asay uses the term "shun" and Ballard urges members to "flee".  Shunning need not be formally imposed to still qualify as shunning.

[^tofleeistoshun]: To "shun" means, according to Merriam-Webster, "to avoid deliberately and especially habitually".  To "flee" from someone seems synonymous with (or perhaps even in excess of) shunning them.  Elder Ballard's talk is referenced in the New Testament Student Manual in association with [2 John 1:7-10](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-jn/1.7-10?lang=eng#6) where John directs Church members to deal with those who do not "confess that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh" to "receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed".  Preceding the quotation of Elder Ballard, the manual explains:

    > John was not suggesting that the Saints should fail to extend common courtesy to those who taught contrary doctrines. However, since early Christian congregations gathered to worship in the homes of Church members, traditional customs of hospitality could inadvertently enable heretical teachers to infiltrate congregations.  Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles warned modern Church members not to associate with deceivers and antichrists operating in our day...

[^othershunning]: Shunning is also endorsed by leaders in some other, somewhat less dramatic ways.

    * **Shun the proselyting efforts**. L. Whitney Clayton clearly qualifies his shunning to focus on the discussion, not the person:

        > We should disconnect immediately and completely from listening to the proselytizing efforts of those who have lost their faith and instead reconnect promptly with the holy spirit.

        Former members are often eager to discuss the reasons they left, but believing members should avoid these kinds of discussions.

    * **Shun by lack of association**.  Shunning may also occur inadvertently merely because a member does not feel that a former member still shares their eternal perspective.  [Thomas S. Monson encouraged members](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/04/be-thou-an-example?lang=eng):

        >  We should associate with those who, like us, are planning not for temporary convenience, shallow goals, or narrow ambition—but rather with those who value the things that matter most, even eternal objectives.

        Hence, former members may easily end up being avoided as a matter of course as members opt to rub shoulders with those who share their worldview.

    * **Shun to avoid endorsing behavior**.  In an interview for the Mormon Newsroom, Dallin H. Oaks was asked how to respond to a homosexual child who wanted to bring a partner home to visit:

    > PUBLIC AFFAIRS: At what point does showing that love cross the line into inadvertently endorsing behavior? If the son says, ‘Well, if you love me, can I bring my partner to our home to visit? Can we come for holidays?’ How do you balance that against, for example, concern for other children in the home?’

    > ELDER OAKS: That’s a decision that needs to be made individually by the person responsible, calling upon the Lord for inspiration. I can imagine that in most circumstances the parents would say, ‘Please don’t do that. Don’t put us into that position.’ Surely if there are children in the home who would be influenced by this example, the answer would likely be that. There would also be other factors that would make that the likely answer.

    > I can also imagine some circumstances in which it might be possible to say, ‘Yes, come, but don’t expect to stay overnight. Don’t expect to be a lengthy house guest. Don’t expect us to take you out and introduce you to our friends, or to deal with you in a public situation that would imply our approval of your “partnership.”

    A non-believing, openly atheist child easily qualifies as "false teacher" or "faith-killer", and it seems reasonable that parents would want to follow Oaks advice to keep them from influencing other children in the home.

[^examplesofshunning]: One woman [describes her treatment](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1n7d45/the_reason_why_i_was_able_to_forgive_my_mother/):

    > My story, in a nutshell - extreme TBM [True-Believing Mormon] family. I left the church. What follows is a decade of, first, silent treatment, then an extremely superficial "truce" on holidays but otherwise not much contact, then outright being forbidden from the family home when my younger brother left the church (I must have corrupted him and torn down his faith, so I'm a danger to the family and must be shunned)...

    Another described [trying to reach out to his close LDS friends after deciding the truth-claims couldn't be supported](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/42maq5/that_time_i_reached_out_to_my_best_friends_during/):

    > So I reached out to one of my best friends from college, because he knew me better than anyone. He responded that he was always willing to talk. I had no idea where to begin. In a short amount of time I had already amassed a huge list of concerns which was overwhelming just to try to mentally sort into categories, much less discuss. So I just gave him a bare list of about 30 concerns and asked if he had any preference where to begin... didn't hear back from him for some time... I eventually got one meaningful response from him, and that was a recommendation that I go to one of our other friends with those questions, because he knew more about church history stuff....So, still desperate to have a meaningful conversation with anybody, I reached out to friend #2. I briefly described my paradigm shift and mentioned that friend #1 had recommended I talk to him. His response was very short. Something to the effect of: "I don't share your beliefs, and I hope you find what you are looking for."  I couldn't believe it. I went into a depression...I have maintained my friendship with friend #1, who has not lost his faith as far as I can tell, and has always been generally uninterested in church history or deep doctrine anyway. I have had no contact with friend #2 since that last message he sent.  I honestly, fully thought my friends would talk to me. We used to talk about everything. I thought I knew them better than that.

    Here's how one girl described her association with her best friend [after telling her she had left](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/5y3c82/my_best_friend_wont_talk_to_me_after_telling_her/):

    > I've been so down the past few days because of this. I told her on the phone (we live in different states) in September, she didn't give me any response until December, an email. Her response was that I was lying, made her feel "dark and dirty", and that I was being judgemental. I told her I was so confused why she thought all that, asked her what I said to make her feel that way.  She's not even willing to talk to me at all anymore because she's worried she'll get defensive and make things worse. I told her the worst thing she could do is say nothing, but apparently she doesn't believe me because she still won't talk to me. It just really, really sucks.  I thought for sure she would take it well and she'd be understanding enough to where it wouldn't TOTALLY change our relationship but I could not have been more wrong.

    Many similar anecdotes can be found on the [exmormon subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon).

[^taughtinmanuals]: The directive to shun faith-killers was repeated [in the 1995 Ensign](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/01/i-have-a-question?lang=eng) and is in the [current Book of Mormon Teacher Resource Manual](https://www.lds.org/manual/book-of-mormon-teacher-resource-manual/alma-30-35?lang=eng).

[^synonymous]: The [New Testament Student Manual](https://www.lds.org/manual/new-testament-student-manual/1-john-2-john-3-john-and-jude/chapter-52-1-john-2-john-3-john-and-jude?lang=eng) uses the terms "antichrist" and "deceiver" somewhat synonymously with those described by Elder Ballard in his talk on false prophets and false teachers in its discussion of 2 John 1:7-10.
