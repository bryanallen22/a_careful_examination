## Introduction

At the time of this writing, aspects of these statements may have applied equally to a member of the Church who was asking to resign since the only way to leave the Church was via excommunication for apostasy.[a lawsuit brought against the Church in the 1980s forced a change to the Church's policy]

## Transcript

The following is a transcript of the 1969 Miracle of Forgiveness, pg 329.  Emphasis added.

### Excommunication

The scriptures speak of Church members being “cast out” or “cut off,” or having their names “blotted out.” This means excommunication. This dread action means the total severance of the individual from the Church. The person who is excommunicated loses his membership in the Church and all attendant blessings. As an excommunicant, he is in a worse situation than he was before he joined the Church.  He has lost the Holy Ghost, his priesthood, his endowments, his sealings, his privileges and his claim upon eternal life.  **This is about the saddest thing which could happen to an individual. Better that he suffer poverty, persecution, sickness, and even death. A true Latter-day Saint would far prefer to see a loved one in his bier than excommunicated from the Church. If the one cut off did not have this feeling of desolateness and barrenness and extreme loss, it would be evidence that he did not understand the meaning of excommunication.**

An excommunicant has no Church privileges. He may not attend priesthood meetings (since he has no priesthood); he may not partake of the sacrament, serve in Church positions, offer public prayers, or speak in meetings; he may not pay tithing except under certain conditions as determined by the bishop. He is “cut off,” “cast out,” and tured over to his Lord for the final judgment. “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God” (Heb. 10:31), and especially already **branded as an apostate or transgressor**.

> Inasmuch as ye are cut off for transgression, ye cannot escape the buffetings of Satan until the day of redemption.

> And I now give unto you power from this very hour, that if any man among you, of the order, is found a transgressor and repenteth not of the evil, that ye shall deliver him over unto the buffetings of Satan; and he shall not have power to bring evil upon you. (D&C 104:9-10.)
