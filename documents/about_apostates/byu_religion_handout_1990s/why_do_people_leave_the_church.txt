3. Becareful about developing an overly-critical attitude about the Chruch and its leaders and teachers; at the same time recognize that neither is perfect.
4. Be careful about developing an over-confident opinion of your Gospel knowledge, testimony, and abilities in relation to others. particularly in relation to Church.1eaders.
