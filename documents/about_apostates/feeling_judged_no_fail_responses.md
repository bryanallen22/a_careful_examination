*From a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/9wl0vb/feeling_judged_heres_10_nofail_responses_to/)*

When you leave the church, it’s possible to hear comments like this directed at you:

* You’ve ruined our eternal family.
* It would be better if you died than left the church.
* Your children need the church in order to make good choices.
* That [bad thing] happened to you because you left the church
* You’ve been deceived by Satan.
* You no longer have the light of Christ.
* I pray something will happen to humble you so you’ll come back to the church.
* You must have done something wrong. Did you cheat on your spouse?

In case you experience this, here's some responses you can keep in your back pocket:

* You are welcome to think that about me. I’m comfortable in my decisions.
* I understand why you might see things that way.
* Thank you. I’m sure you meant that in the kindest way possible.
* I’m sorry to hear that’s what’s going through your head.
* I can only imagine that it’s hard for you to understand where I’m coming from.
* If you're hurting for me, I want you to know I’m at peace. If you're hurting for you, I hope you can find comfort in whatever way works best for you.
* It must be scary for you to see me leave the church. I’m sorry you’re having such a hard time making sense of all this.
* You sound worried. I know you wouldn’t worry if you didn’t care.
* There may not be anything I can do to that would lead you to see me differently, but if you ever want to listen with an open mind, I’d be willing to share my journey.
* You might be right. If you are -- that's fine. I don't need to be right.
