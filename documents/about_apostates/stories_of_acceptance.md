> Her parents attended the same student ward as my parents when they all went to ucla together. We've known each other since birth and I've been hella afraid at how a tbm would react - especially that tbm. She said she supported me, doesn't understand the churches policy on 'ssa' (I'm gay) and would be there as I go through the process of ending my mission early. It turns out better than you'd think :')
> Edit: she just competed her mission on temple square and is preparing to be married in the temple!
