[Abusers stigmatize anger, so that their victims won't protest when they are abused.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/74a9kz/abusers_stigmatize_anger_so_that_their_victims/)

I'm reading Pete Walker's book, "Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving," and this is something I've learned from the book and have been pondering the last couple of days. Here are some things I've learned about anger from this book:

* Anger is a normal and healthy emotion when expressed appropriately.
* Anger is expressed appropriately when it is expressed without hurting yourself or others.
* Anger is a sign of abuse. It is a natural feeling of indignation when one's boundaries are crossed.
* Sometimes people have to get angry before they will stand up for themselves.
* People will put up with a lot of bullshit if they aren't angry. Therefore, abusers teach their victims that being angry is wrong.
* An additional insight from my husband: abusers get angry at you for getting angry. It's a double hypocritical mindfuck.

One letter of [a transitioning member trying to explain](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/7ia4s7/how_do_i_help_my_super_tbm_wife_understand_why_i/):

> One thing you know about me is I tend to be an all or nothing type of person. This is certainly true of me in the aspect of the church. For 30+ years I was all in on the church. I was never inactive for any point in my life. I paid tithing on the gross of every dime I ever made (over $100,000!), I never broke the word of wisdom, I spent 2 years of my life on a mission, I spent 4 years in seminary. I gave it all I could and I did it because it was true. I knew the church was true based on what I was taught at home, church, and seminary. It was my life and a core part of my identity.

> After giving my all for 30+ years, I found out I was wrong. What I was taught was a lie. I am angry at myself for being deceived for so long. But I am mostly angry at the church. I’m not angry that it is false, I am angry that the church has very deliberately and intentionally crafted a false narrative and sold it to me as true. They set up a structure where they were the only valid source of information. (Beware of anti-mormon literature, the devil will deceive you.) Then hid any information that didn’t fit the their narrative regardless of truth.

> Now that I have discovered the truth, I am triggered every time I see the church misleading it’s members. I am triggered whenever I feel it’s tentacles still wrapped around my personal choices. I am triggered by knowing that it is still deceiving the people that I love and there is nothing that I can do about it.

> Feeling angry at this stage is normal and expected. I just lost a core part of my identity, of course it will take some time to work through. Even though I feel my anger is justified, I can’t wait for the day where I am able to move passed it.
