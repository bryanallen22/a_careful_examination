[Abusers stigmatize anger, so that their victims won't protest when they are abused.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/74a9kz/abusers_stigmatize_anger_so_that_their_victims/)

I'm reading Pete Walker's book, "Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving," and this is something I've learned from the book and have been pondering the last couple of days. Here are some things I've learned about anger from this book:

* Anger is a normal and healthy emotion when expressed appropriately.
* Anger is expressed appropriately when it is expressed without hurting yourself or others.
* Anger is a sign of abuse. It is a natural feeling of indignation when one's boundaries are crossed.
* Sometimes people have to get angry before they will stand up for themselves.
* People will put up with a lot of bullshit if they aren't angry. Therefore, abusers teach their victims that being angry is wrong.
* An additional insight from my husband: abusers get angry at you for getting angry. It's a double hypocritical mindfuck.
