## Introduction

Nearly all humans recognize that some kinds of transcendent experience open our minds to new ideas and perspectives.  A theist typically believes that the most important revelation comes from the divine, but all humans are united in seeking revelation, broadly defined---all of us value insight into our nature and connectedness with one another and the universe regardless of our belief in God(s).

Like "love languages," these six sources of revelation can be thought of as "spiritual languages."  Some people may receive more revelation from one source than another, and perhaps the volume of revelation from different sources may change over the course of a person's life.  There's probably value in trying to understand which sources others resonate with most and occasionally exploring or revisiting sources that we may have neglected in our spiritual development.

1. **Personal Revelation**: Personal revelation is arguably the most important source of revelation, because it emphasizes personal responsibility for discovery and growth. Benjamin Franklin once wrote "God helps those who help themselves."  Personal revelation encourages a person to learn as much as they can and sift through ideas to find what resonates most with them and what is most grounded in transcendent goodness.

2. **Teachers**: Life is a very difficult journey for all of us. Going to those who are personally trusted for guidance often makes life easier to navigate. Those whom we seek guidance from can have many different titles and can include family, friends, or spiritual leaders.

3. **Community**: Talking and serving with others helps us learn and build connection.  Some find community in formal groups dedicated to spiritual growth.  Formal groups create space for sharing personal revelations,  discussing scripture, and performing rituals.  Others may find community in less formal associations (e.g., a group of close friends with whom spiritual insights are shared).

4. **Scriptures**: Scripture may be viewed as sacred writing (typically, but not necessarily, from past generations) that convey valuable lessons or reveal truths about our nature or inter-connectedness.  These writings may be fiction, non-fiction, or somewhere in between.

5. **Tools**: Tools are often used as a reminder of something or are used to produce greater understanding.  Tools may include things like jewelry, symbols, clothing, grooming styles, names or titles, food, or entheogens.  Tools may also include places of worship or reflection such as churches, temples, or being in nature.

6. **Rituals**: Rituals are formalized and/or symbolic actions that are based in tradition. They often mark a milestone in life, symbolize a commitment, give advice or comfort, or convey a desire for things to change.  Formal religious rituals might include things such as prayer, fasting, baptism, or weddings.  More secular (but still sacred) ritutals might be graduation ceremonies and memorial services.
