Theists believe that revelation can come from a divine source, but atheists or agnostics also recognize that transcendent experiences open our minds to new ideas and perspectives.  Most humans seek revelation (i.e., insight into our true nature and our connectedness with one another and the universe) in one way or another.

Instead of “love languages”, these can be thought of as “spiritual languages”. Some people gain more revelations through one method over another. Some may gain no revelation from a source.

1. **Personal Revelation**: Personal revelation is arguably the most important source of revelation, because it emphasizes personal responsibility for discovery and growth. Benjamin Franklin once wrote “God helps those who help themselves”. Personal revelation encourages a person to learn as much as they can and make a determination based on the evidence they've been given.

2. **Teachers**: Life is a very difficult journey for all of us. Going to those who are personally trusted for guidance often makes life easier to navigate. Those whom we seek guidance from can have many different titles and can include family, friends, or spiritual leaders.

3. **Community**: Talking and serving with others helps us learn and build connection.  Some find community in formal groups dedicated to spiritual growth.  Formal groups create space for sharing personal revelations,  discussing scripture, and performing rituals.  Others may find community in less formal associations (e.g., a group of close friends with whom spiritual insights are shared).

4. **Scriptures**: Scripture may be viewed as sacred writing (typically from past generations) that convey valuable lessons or reveal truths about our nature or inter-connectedness.  These writings may be fiction, non-fiction, or somewhere in between.

    People consider different writings scripture to them since different lessons may resonate well with one person, but not as much for another.

5. **Tools**: Tools are often used as a reminder of something or is used to produce greater understanding.

    Traditional Mormon tools include, but not limited to, oil vials, jewelry, clothing, grooming styles, names/titles, symbols, art, music, seer stones, food, and entheogens. Tools can also be places including, but not limited to, temples, meetinghouses, or being in nature.

6. **Rituals**: Rituals are formalized and/or symbolic actions that are based in tradition. They often mark a milestone in life, symbolize a commitment, give advice or comfort, or convey a desire for things to change.

    Traditional Mormon rituals include, but are not limited to prayer, family home evening, baptism, blessings, fasting, sacrament, dusting off shoes, ordinations, endowments, and weddings/sealings.
