All the "miracles" I have ever observed or heard about are type 1
miracles[^originalpublication]:

## Type 1 Miracles:

1. **Manifestations produced by the human mind** -- the brain is complex and doesn't always represent reality one-to-one; auditory and visual hallucinations are relatively common.
2. **Natural, but rare, occurrences** -- for instance, people sometimes spontaneously come back to life after being dead a short period of time.
3. **Coincidence + confirmation bias (related to #2)** -- we remember all the crazy coincidences but forget all the times when the ordinary happened.  Events that are highly unlikely will still happen sometimes.

In a universe where miracles do not exist we would still expect phenomena that *appear to be miracles*, but are limited to the above kinds of phenomena:

* a person reports the visitation of a "heavenly being" who behaves according to their expectations (with no external evidence to support the visitation)
* an extremely lucky kid gets run over by a truck but is somehow okay after the community's faith healer blesses him and the initial trauma wears off
* a person naturally begins breathing again after being "dead" for a few hours
* a person who is blind starts seeing again; you meet a friend on a path at *exactly* the moment you felt you needed someone to be there.
* cancer remits after a blessing and following the advice of a Priesthood leader

## Type 2 Miracles:

In a universe where miracles are real, we would expect the above phenomena (and maybe some of them *are* genuine miracles in this universe), but we would also expect these kinds of things:

* Well-documented (i.e., video recording) of heavenly manifestations where the heavenly being displays multiple highly extraordinary capabilities.
* People who had been dead for *years* come back to life
* A person who had been *incinerated* came back to life
* Someone who *had no eyeballs* *instantly* grew a pair of eyeballs and could see again
* Someone whose limb had been severed *instantly* grew a new limb, etc.
* Someone literally moves *an entire mountain* at their command, as suggested in the BoM and JST.

IMHO, the evidence strongly suggests a universe where miracles do not occur but certain kinds of phenomena are routinely interpreted as a miracle.

### What about a God who doesn't want to be detected?

We cannot distinguish between a universe where miracles exist from one where an omnipotent and omniscient being can and does perform miracles (i.e., he *could* do type 2 miracles) but ensures that all miracles **look** like type 1 miracles to prevent the unworthy from being convinced of his/her/its existence.  However, we can then conclude that if we are not convinced of the existence of God via type 1 miracles, then we are merely following the will of God (i.e., if God really wanted to convince us through miracles, he could easily do so with type 2 miracles).

Therefore, the only logical position is to *not* believe in the existence of God based on type 1 miracles (whether God exists and is behind type 1 miracles or not).
