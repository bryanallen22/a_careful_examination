The Church teaches that Adam and Eve walked out of the Garden of Eden into what is present day Missouri, USA.

### Current teachings

1. The recently leaked [Guideline Responses to Common Questions](https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/index.php?title=File:Guideline_Responses_to_Common_Questions.pdf) is given to all General Authorities upon accepting their assignment. It contains the following response to the question “Was the Garden of Eden in Missouri?”

    > Strictly speaking, we do not know where the Garden of Eden was. Joseph Smith established a settlement called Adam-ondi-Ahman in Daviess County, Missouri. While not an important or foundational doctrine, **Latter-day Saints believe that Adam and Eve dwelt in that area after being expelled from the Garden of Eden**. (emphasis added)
