Joseph Smith made [*many* public denials that he was practicing polygamy](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/common-questions/polygamy-denials/).  In an effort to exonerate him, some take him at his word and claim that polygamy was an invention of Brigham Young.

However, fairly strong *contemporary* evidence exists that Joseph Smith practiced polygamy:

1. [Oliver Cowdery's letter to Warren A. Cowdery, Jan 21, 1838](https://imgur.com/UXN9wpv).  Note that all surrounding events and testimony (including the fact that Cowdery never retracted his accusation) corroborate that Joseph Smith was intimately involved with Fanny Alger.
2. [D&C 132, received 12 July 1843](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-12-july-1843-dc-132/1).

In addition, a trio of primary documents, all signed or in Joseph Smith's hand strongly implicate him in plural marriage with Sarah Ann Whitney.  The three documents together would be very difficult to explain outside the context of a plural marriage.

1. [Blessing to Sarah Ann Whitney](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/blessing-to-sarah-ann-whitney-23-march-1843/1) [in Joseph Smith's hand] Sarah turned 18 the day before.
2. [Deed to Sarah Ann Whitney](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/deed-to-sarah-ann-whitney-6-september-1842/1) [signed by Joseph Smith] Sarah was 17 years old at the time of this deed.
3. [Letter to the Whitneys](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-the-whitneys-18-august-1842/1) [in Joseph Smith's hand] Sarah was 17 years old at the time.

[need to summarize key arguments here]

### Conclusion

Far more contemporary evidence exists implicating Joseph Smith in polygamy than exists for most foundational LDS events (e.g., restoration of the Priesthood or the First Vision).
