## Introduction

This is a survey I designed and began to administer.  Unfortunely, change in employment prevented me from conducting the survey.  Nonetheless, the kinds of questions being asked should give researchers a better understanding of the objective/subjective nature of purported divine manifestations.

## Survey Introduction

This survey has been designed to better understand the experiences of those who have had visitations with divine messengers/beings (for example, a visitation with Jesus Christ, an angelic messenger, or perhaps a demonic messenger)

The survey is anonymous (no email addresses are collected).  You are under no obligation to participate, and you are free to withdraw from the survey at any time you like.

I was an academically trained professor (no longer in academia) who is interested in studying divine visitations.  The study is strictly informal (unrelated to my employment or any other affiliation of mine) and is being conducted simply because I am interested in better understanding the nature of people's experiences.  There is no compensation provided for participating, but when I have completed the survey I plan to post all raw results and analyses to [site].

Thank you for your participation.
