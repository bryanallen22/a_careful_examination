## Why be skeptical of reports of Apostles seeing Jesus?

1. 5% of the general population (_non-schizophrenic_) have experienced hallucinations ([summary](https://www.livescience.com/50999-hallucinations-delusions-common.html), [article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2298236))
1. Many Church leaders, particular Apostles, probably spend significant time ruminating on a potential visit with Jesus.  So, if they hallucinate something, Jesus seems like a good candidate.
1. Given that the apostle office comes with the charge to see Jesus, the apostles are likely to be highly suggestible.  We know from experiments with the [Koren helmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helmet) that spiritual experience is a highly suggestible phenomenon.
1. People in different cultures hallucinate different deities.  Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi, a well-known religion psychologist, [explained](https://books.google.com/books?id=EfNTBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=we+take+it+for+granted+benjamin+beit-hallahmi&source=bl&ots=Tgq6kGK3_5&sig=SdRbPV6WkxQBtF0pPubciSq2B60&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi8lPqO95HWAhVD82MKHd7XB4cQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22We%20know%20that%20the%20specific%20content%20of%20visions%22&f=false): 

    > Mystical experiences, considered unique and individual, are totally culture-dpendent.  We know that the specific content of visions, the most intense and personal of religious acts, is wholly predictable from exposure to certain ideas, which are always learned.  Visions of the Holy Virgin occur exclusively among Catholics or those exposed to Catholic ideas.  They have never occurred among Orthodox Jews...

1. Apostles are instructed to give vague, re-assuring answers, if they are asked about seeing God.
1. In LDS thought, strong spiritual feelings (particularly if experienced over many years) may be considered "knowing" something.  Similarly, experience with improbable events seems to be enough to give a person "knowledge".
1. Many people are [on record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visions_of_Jesus_and_Mary) as having seen and spoken with Jesus, but most of them do not take that to mean the LDS Church is true.  I had a very close friend who was certain that he'd had a personal visitation with Jesus.  That person is also just as convinced that the LDS Church is in apostasy.
