# Lack of significant revelation

Church leaders have not received revelation comparable to those recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants in nearly 100 years--D&C 138, the last section in the Doctrine and Covenants, was received in 1918.

When introducing it in General Conference, Gordon B. Hinckley expressly declared that the Family Proclamation was a reaffirmation of what has been repeatedly taught:

> ...a declaration and reaffirmation of standards, doctrines, and practices relative to the family which the prophets, seers, and revelators of this church have repeatedly stated throughout its history.

The reversal of the priesthood ban was given, after many days praying in the temple, in this fashion:

> There grew slowly a deep, abiding impression to go forward with the change. (from Lengthen Your Stride, by Edward Kimball; as cited [here](http://mormonheretic.org/2012/07/22/the-non-verbal-1978-revelation/))

# The Family Proclamation was used by the church as a legal document

The Proclamation was used in [the 1997 appeal on same sex marriage in the Hawaiin Supreme Court](http://www.qrd.org/qrd/usa/legal/hawaii/baehr/1997/brief.mormons-04.14.97).  It was presented to the church less than one year after the church's case was thrown out of the Hawaii Supreme court [in March of 1995](http://www.mormonsocialscience.org/2008/01/04/richley-crapo-chronology-of-mormon-lds-involvement-in-same-sex-marriage-politics/).

# There was no global flood at 2500 BC

All evidence strongly suggests that there was no global flood at ~2500 B.C.  This fact is strongly attested to by data you can touch and see: the tree-ring, varve, and speleothem data and indirectly by the species diversity in the earth.  Even FAIR Mormon admits this without equivocation:

> Modern scientific knowledge regarding the diversity of species, language and evidence of continuous human habitation does not support the Biblical story that a global flood wiped out most life as recently as 4,400 years ago ([FAIR Mormon, 2015-12-02](http://en.fairmormon.org/Mormonism_and_science/Global_or_local_Flood))

However, the idea of a global flood was common in the early 1800's and there was much speculation about how this could have occurred ([an example from a Bible Dictionary of the time](https://books.google.com/books?id=6etiAAAAcAAJ&pg=PT354&dq=%22waters+covered+the+whole+earth%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiEu9TjnL7JAhVCrB4KHULpA1YQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&q=%22waters%20covered%20the%20whole%20earth%22&f=false)).  In addition, the idea of the Flood being a baptism of the earth was an idea that was common before church leaders began preaching it and was [common in sources that LDS leaders were likely to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3n5386/the_flood_as_the_earths_baptism_origin_in_lds/).

However, as FAIR also admits, "without a doubt, the flood is always treated as a global event as it is taught by Church leaders." ([FAIR Mormon, 2015-12-02](http://en.fairmormon.org/Mormonism_and_science/Global_or_local_Flood))

# Mankind did not begin with two individuals.

The official stance comes from the First Presidency Statement of 1909:

> It is held by some that Adam was not the first man upon this earth and that the original human being was a development from lower orders of the animal creation. These, however, are the theories of men. The word of the Lord declared that Adam was “the first man of all men” (Moses 1:34), and we are therefore in duty bound to regard him as the primal parent of our race.

Virtually all church leaders have taught or implied this since the Church's inception, and this follows traditional Christian thinking.

However, the evidence strongly suggests that [humankind derived from a population of individuals, not a single pair](http://biologos.org/blogs/dennis-venema-letters-to-the-duchess/does-genetics-point-to-a-single-primal-couple).

# Mankind did not begin 6000 years ago.

The timing for the earth's temporal existence is taught by direct revelation from God in D&C 77:

6 Q. What are we to understand by the book which John saw, which was sealed on the back with seven seals?
A. We are to understand that it contains the revealed will, mysteries, and the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence.

It is a commonly held belief [derived from a straightforward reading of the
bible](http://creation.com/6000-years) and has been common among Christians
since before the church's creation.

However, the scientific evidence is extremely strong that [humans themselves have existed
for much longer than this]().

# There was death on the earth before 6000 years ago.

Rather, Joseph Fielding Smith [borrowed this idea from the writings of George McCready Price](https://books.google.com/books?id=UaR6KXQncbwC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218&dq=george+mccready+price+adam+eve+death+fall&source=bl&ots=1tzvu2GOkL&sig=teMj745RQy_ImTKOKQ11uYjAKfA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiN2vG2_bTJAhWPWogKHS7nDgcQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&q=george%20mccready%20price%20adam%20eve%20death%20fall&f=false), a Seventh Day Adventist and young earth creationist

# Joseph Smith misled most everyone about polygamy

Emma, the church, and the public about practicing polygamy.

X. Coffee and tea are not bad for you (in moderation).

First, a little intro to tea which is necessary to understand the research.  Tea comes from steeping parts of Camellia sinensis in hot or boiled water.  Depending on the level of oxidation of the tea leaves, you get different types of true tea: white, oolong, green, and black tea.  Herbal teas are made in the same way, but not using the Camellia sinensis plant.  So, just to be clear, green tea is *real* tea.

Having taught it my entire life, I was thoroughly convinced that coffee and
tea are quite harmful.  We also grew up in a generation where this was the
accepted medical wisdom, but it was because researchers lumped smokers in with
coffee and tea drinkers:

> The idea that coffee is a dangerous, addictive stimulant springs mostly from 1970s- and 1980s-era studies that tied the drink to higher rates of cancer and heart disease, explains Dr. Rob van Dam, a disease and nutrition expert at Harvard School of Public Health who has examined coffee and its health effects. According to van Dam, that old research didn't do a great job of adjusting for a person's cigarette habit or other unhealthy behaviors. ([source](http://time.com/3145435/is-coffee-bad-for-you/))

I forced myself to sit down and examine the latest data, going 
Current research suggests that coffee is health-promoting, or neutral, overall, rather than "harmful"
the past 5 years, you will find that tea and coffee are at best *good for you*
and at worst, neutral.

As Saints, we've forbidden ourselves relatively healthy drinks enjoyed by mankind for
thousands of years (complete with rich traditions), and traded them for less
healthy alternatives, like soft-drinks and fruit juice.

In fact, it turns out that the destroying angel visited the saints *because*
they did not drink hot drinks on their trek.  It turns out that the biggest documented killer on the pioneer trek was
from cholera ([40% of all
travelers](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865607624/When-Mormon-pioneers-left-often-was-a-life-or-death-proposition.html?pg=all)).  Why did God tell them to avoid hot drinks?  Had they simply boiled their water before drinking it (i.e., made any kind of hot drink), they would have avoided hundreds, if not thousands of needless deaths along their trek.

# But the church makes me happy

In the latest Pew results, Orthodox Jews were found to report higher levels of
happiness than Mormons.  So, if you genuinely do not care about truth, but rather care more
about being happy, then why do you not convert to Orthodox Judaism?
