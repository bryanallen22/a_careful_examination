## Ruth Vose Sayers

### 1869 Affidavit

Ruth Vose's 1869 affidavit makes no distinction between sealing and marriage.
She also does not specify that the sealing was for eternity only (emphasis
added):

> Be it remembered that on this first day of May, A.D. 1869, personally appeared before me, Elias Smith, Probate Judge for Said County, Ruth Vose Sayers who was by me Sworn in due form of law and upon her oath Saith that on [blank] day of February A.D. 1843 at the City of Nauvoo County of Hancock, State of Illinois, **She was married or Sealed** to Joseph Smith President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, by Hyrum Smith, Presiding Patriarch of Said Church, according to the laws of the Same, regulating Marriage; in the presence of Ruth V. Sayers; Subscribed and sworn by the said Ruth V. Sayers, the day and year first above written; E. Smith; Probate Judge

Hales [notes](https://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/ruth-vose/): "However the affidavit states that the sealing was performed by Hyrum Smith, which is unlikely because Hyrum did not accept plural marriage until May of that year."

### Andrew Jenson Papers [ca. 1871--1942], LDS Archives

Andrew Jenson apparently had some documentation regarding Ruth Vose's
relationship and sealing:

> Sister Ruth/ Mrs. Sayers was married in her youth to Mr. Edward Sayers, a thoroughly practical horticulturist and florist, and though he was not a member of the Church, yet he willingly joined his fortune with her and they reached Nauvoo together some time in the year 1841;

> While there the strongest affection sprang up between the Prophet Joseph and Mr. Sayers. The latter not attaching much importance to the/ theory of a future life insisted that his wife Ruth/ should be sealed to the Prophet for eternity, as he himself should only claim [page2—the first 3 lines of which are written over illegible erasures] her in this life. She was/ accordingly the sealed to the Prophet in Emma Smith’s presence and thus were became numbered among the Prophets plural wives. She however though she/ continued to live with Mr. Sayers / remained with her husband until his death.

From Andrew Jenson Papers [ca. 1871–1942], LDS Archives [as cited by Hales](https://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/ruth-vose/#link_ajs-fn-id_7-5666). "It appears that the documents in these folders were used to compile Jenson’s 1887 Historical Record article on plural marriage. See Joseph F. Smith affidavit books, LDS Archives, 1:9 for date of this sealing 'February A.D. 1843.' However the affidavit states that the sealing was performed by Hyrum Smith, which is unlikely because Hyrum did not accept plural marriage until May of that year."

Dan Vogel has noted that in this documentation it was apparently Edward Sayers who suggested the eternity sealing, so caution should be taken in extrapolating this to all the other polyandrous marriages.

## Temple Lot Case - Malissa Lott

In footnote #6 of Brian Hales's [Ruth Vose page](https://web.archive.org/web/20200708214336/https://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/ruth-vose/), Hales writes:

> Recognizing that Joseph Smith’s marriages could have been for either “time and eternity” or just “eternity,” P.P. Kelley questioned Malissa Lott in 1892 regarding the type of sealing ceremony that she experienced with the him: “Did you live with Joseph Smith as his wife, or were you just simply sealed to him for eternity?”(Temple Lot Case, complete transcript, part 3, pages 97, questions 94.) Malissa, who was single at the time of her sealing to the Prophet, had earlier stated: “I was married to him for time and all eternity.”(Ibid., page 95, question 56)

note: I have not been able to find the testimony that Hales references, but it should be accessible in the transcripts on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/TempleLotCaseTranscript) or [online at the Church History Library](https://catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org/record/d41946ae-97f6-42c7-b8ca-747ee67d8dee/0?view=browse).

## Helen Mar Kimball 1881 account

Hales writes "The primary document referring to the relationship is an 1881
poem penned by Helen that has been interpreted in different ways". The letter,
including the poem, is reproduced from a complete transcript
[here](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/helen-mar-kimball-whitney-1881-autobiography/):

> Just previous to my father’s starting upon his last mission but one, to the Eastern States, he taught me the principle [p. 1] of Celestial marriage, & having a great desire to be connected with the Prophet, Joseph, he offered me to him; this I afterwards learned from the Prophet’s own mouth. My father had but one Ewe Lamb, but willingly laid her upon the alter: how cruel this seamed to the mother whose heartstrings were already stretched untill they were ready to snap asunder, for he had taken Sarah Noon to wife & she thought she had made sufficient sacrafise, but the Lord required more. I will pass over the temptations which I had during the twenty four hours after my father introduced to me this principle & asked me if I would be sealed to Joseph, who came next morning & with my parents I heard him teach & explain the principle of [p. 1] Celestial marrage-after which he said to me, “If you will take this step, it will ensure your eternal salvation and exaltation & that of your father’s household & all of your kindred.

> This promise was so great that I will-ingly gave myself to purchase so glorious a reward. None but God & his angels could see my mother’s bleeding heart—when Joseph asked her if she was willing, she replied “If Helen is willing I have nothing more to say.” She had witnessed the sufferings of others, who were older & who better understood the step they were taking, & to see her child, who had scarcely seen her fifteenth summer, following in the same thorny path, in her mind she saw the misery which was as sure to come as the sun was to rise and set; but it was all hidden from me.

> I thought through this life my time will be my own<br/>
> The step I now am taking’s for eternity alone,<br/>
> No one need be the wiser, through time I shall be free,<br/>
> And as the past hath been the future still will be.<br/>
> To my guileless heart all free from worldly care<br/>
> And full of blissful hopes—and youthful visions rare<br/>
> The world seamed bright the thret’ning clouds were kept<br/>
> From sight, and all looked fair but pitying angels wept.<br/>
> They saw my youthful friends grow shy and cold.<br/>
> And poisonous darts from sland’rous tongues were hurled,<br/>
> Untutor’d heart in thy gen’rous sacrafise,<br/>
> Thou dids’t not weigh the cost nor know the bitter price;<br/>
> Thy happy dreems all o’er thou’rt doom’d alas to be<br/>
> Bar’d out from social scenes by this thy destiny,<br/>
> And o’er thy sad’nd mem’ries of sweet departed joys<br/>
> Thy sicken’d heart will brood and imagine future woes,<br/>
> And like a fetter’d bird with wild and longing heart,<br/>
> Thou’lt dayly pine for freedom and murmor at thy lot;<br/>
> But could’st thou see the future & view that glorious crown,<br/>
> Awaiting you in Heaven you would not weep nor mourn, [p. 2]<br/>
> Pure and exalted was thy father’s aim, he saw<br/>
> A glory in obeying this high celestial law,<br/>
> For to thousands who’ve died without the light<br/>
> I will bring eternal joy & make thy crown more bright.<br/>
> I’d been taught to receive the Prophet of God<br/>
> And receive every word as the word of the Lord.<br/>
> But had this not come through my dear father’s mouth,<br/>
> I should ne’r have received it as God’s sacred truth.<br/>

Hales also [quotes some of Helen's writing from a year later](https://josephsmithspolygamy.org/common-questions/14-year-old-wives-teenage-brides/):

> During the winter of 1843, there were plenty of parties and balls. … Some of the young gentlemen got up a series of dancing parties, to be held at the Mansion once a week. … I had to stay home, as my father had been warned by the Prophet to keep his daughter away from there, because of the blacklegs and certain ones of questionable character who attended there. … I felt quite sore over it, and thought it a very unkind act in father to allow [my brother] to go and enjoy the dance unrestrained with others of my companions, and fetter me down, for no girl loved dancing better than I did, and I really felt that it was too much to bear. It made the dull school still more dull, and like a wild bird I longer for the freedom that was denied me; and thought myself a much abused child, and that it was pardonable if I did murmur.

And he then argues:

> Helen’s feelings certainly don’t reflect those of one who considered herself married. Fourteen is young, but certainly old enough to understand the expectations of a married woman. It seems that if Helen were sexually involved with the Prophet as a plural wife, her anticipation of pregnancy and other wifely responsibilities might have made it clear to her that she was no longer single. In view of the conservative sexual standards embraced at that time, her longings to dance with teenage boys and otherwise socialize may have been subdued as she submitted to her wifehood.

## Reed Smoot Hearings

Reed Smoot Hearings from 1906 give some insight into how later leaders viewed
sealings and the prevalence of eternity only sealings.

Besides the quoted transcript, *all the below words are Johnny Stephenson's* (as documented by Mithryn [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/4n5jbt/novery_few_eternityonly_sealings_dynastic/)).

Angus M. Cannon (who was the nephew of John Taylor) immigrated to Nauvoo in 1842 with his family and went west with the Church. His older brother was George Q. Cannon. He also served in the mission field with John Taylor and was the President of the Salt Lake City Stake and it was said of him that he “was without equal in the field of Church law.”

At the Reed Smoot hearings Cannon testified about sealings:

[Beginning at [pg 793](https://archive.org/details/SmootHearings/Smoot_1/page/n793/mode/2up)]

> ...<br/>
>Senator OVERMAN. What do you mean by a sealing-for-eternity ceremony?<br/>
>Mr. CANNON. A marriage for eternity.<br/>
>Senator OVERMAN. As different from a marriage upon this earth ?<br/>
>Mr. CANNON. Sir?<br/>
>Senator OVERMAN. Different from the ordinary marriage?<br/>
>Mr. CANNON. Oh; there is a ceremony for marriage for time and also for eternity.<br/>
>Senator OVERMAN. Are your wives sealed to you for time or for eternity?<br/>
>Mr. CANNON. Time and eternity.<br/>
>Senator OVERMAN. Time and eternity both all six of them?<br/>
> Mr. CANNON. Yes, sir.<br/>
>Senator OVERMAN. Are there such marriages as sealing for time and sealing for eternity, and some for time' and some for eternity?<br/>
>**Mr. CANNON. I have witnessed many marriages for time. I never witnessed any for eternity and not for time.**<br/>
>Senator OVERMAN. Are there such marriages as that?<br/>
>Mr. CANNON. I can not say whether there are or not. Of course there are marriages performed between living people and dead people, by having persons act vicariously for the dead.<br/>
>Senator OVERMAN. There are such marriages, then, with dead people ?<br/>
>Mr. CANNON. That is necessarily for eternity. It cannot be for time.<br/>
>Senator OVERMAN. I say, you do have such marriages as that?<br/>
>Mr. CANNON. Yes, sir.<br/>
>Senator OVERMAN. A living person marrying a dead person?<br/>
>Mr. CANNON. By the dead person being represented by a living person.<br/>
>Senator OVERMAN. By having a representative here on earth he marries a living person here ?<br/>
>Mr. CANNON. Yes, sir; vicariously, the same as Paul spoke of baptism for the dead.<br/>
>Senator OVERMAN. Have you seen such marriages as that?<br/>
>Mr. CANNON. Yes, sir; acting for the dead.<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. That does not result in the marriage for time between the proxy and the person who is married to the other for eternity only, does it?<br/>
>Mr. CANNON. No; it only relates to the dead.<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. Do you recall any instances in the history of the church where the proxy vicariously representing the dead person has insisted that for time the woman was his?<br/>
>Mr. CANNON. No; I never heard of such a thing. We would cut them off the church if they did.<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. I would think so. That is all.<br/>
> ...<br/>

Joseph F. Smith also testified,

[Beginning at [pg 181](https://archive.org/details/SmootHearings/Smoot_1/page/n181/mode/2up?q=two+instance)]

> ...<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. And do you have as many different kinds of marriage now as formerly ?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. We have as many different kinds of marriage now as formerly.<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. Let me call your attention to what I mean, because it will save time: Sealing for time only, sealing for time and eternity, and sealing for eternity only.<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. Yes, sir.<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. Do you have those ?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. Yes, sir.<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. All three of them ?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. All three of them.<br/>
> ...<br/>

[Beginning at [pg 184](https://archive.org/details/SmootHearings/Smoot_1/page/n185/mode/2up?q=two+instance)]

> ...<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. Do you perform celestial marriage ceremonies now?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. That is simply a marriage for time and eternity.<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. Time and eternity ?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. That is what it means, nothing more and nothing less.<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. That, according to the civil or municipal law, is an ordinary marriage, is it not?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. Those that are married in that way outside of the temples, it is simply a civil contract for time, but where they have obtained [185] these licenses and go to the temples to be married they are sealed for time and eternity.<br/>
>**Mr. TAYLER. Are there sealings still going on for eternity alone, not for time?**<br/>
>**Mr. SMITH. Not that I know of, unless the parties are dead.**<br/>
>Senator FORAKER. Do you marry people for eternity and not for time?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. When they are dead; yes, sir.<br/>
>Senator FORAKER. You marry them after they are dead?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. After they are dead; and, Mr. Senator, we do not have to have a license from the court to do that.<br/>
>Senator FORAKER. That is simply a church marriage?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. That is just simply a principle that we believe in, that men and women are immortal beings.<br/>
>Senator FORAKER. Are both the parties to that marriage dead at the time it is solemnized?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. Yes, sir; they are often dead, and they are represented by their heirs, either their sons or daughters, or some of their kinsmen.<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. Living persons have been united for eternity, have they not?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. I think there have been some few cases of that kind.<br/>
>Mr. VAN COTT. To what time, Mr. Tayler, do you limit your question ?<br/>
>**Mr. TAYLER. I was going to ask him. How recently have you known that kind of a marriage?**<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. Not very recently.<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. Do you mean five years or twenty -five years?<br/>
>**Mr. SMITH. Oh, twenty years or more.**<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. Is there any rule of the church prohibiting that kind of marriage?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. Not that I know of.<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. It has merely fallen into disuse; is that all?<br/>
>**Mr. SMITH. It has merely fallen into disuse; that is all. I do not know that it could be said to have fallen absolutely into disuse.**<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. Or rather, that the principle which still adheres has not been invoked or exercised so often?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. No, sir; it has not been invoked.<br/>
> ...<br/>

With further questioning we learn, [need to locate]

>Mr. WORTHINGTON. You said you remembered two instances where persons had been sealed by the church for eternity; you said one or two instances?<br/>
>**Mr. SMITH. Yes, sir; one or two instances.**<br/>
>Mr. WORTHINGTON. How long ago were those?<br/>
>**Mr. SMITH. Twenty-five to thirty years ago.**<br/>

Taylor then wants everyone to totally understand what Smith is saying and further questions him: [need to locate]

>Mr. TAYLER. Just one question. I want to be sure that I understand you correctly. You say that Apostle Teasdale told you that to this wife, from whom he had to obtain a divorce, he had been sealed for eternity only?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. Yes, sir.<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. That he had not been married either for time or for time and eternity, but only for that third form eternity only?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. Well, now, Mr. Tayler, I could not tell you as to the form of the ceremony.<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. I understand that. I am not speaking about that. But it was merely for eternity ?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. That is the understanding they had. It was for eternity, and not for time.<br/>
>Mr. TAYLER. Exactly; and therefore the relations between them as contemplated at the time of the ceremony were that they should never cohabit ?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. Never cohabit.<br/>
>Mr. WORTHINGTON. Therefore his relations with her were as chaste as if she were his sister or a stranger to him ?<br/>
>Mr. SMITH. Perfectly so.<br/>

Smith was only aware of a "few cases of that kind". It was not very prevalent, so unusual that Angus Cannon had never heard or participated in one. But they did happen, rarely.

(Remember, Smith had collected as many affidavits from Joseph Smith’s polygamous wives that he could in 1869, so he was familiar with those “marriages”). In fact they were so rare that Angus Cannon (who also testified) had never performed or seen one. 

To project this back to the Nauvoo Era is disingenuous, since there is no credible evidence that they ever occurred in Nauvoo. In fact, on one occasion, Heber C. Kimball wanted to do just that, but Joseph Smith Jr. refused to let him. From Helen Kimball:

"When first hearing the principle taught, believing that he would be called upon to enter into it, he had thought of two elderly ladies named Pitkin, great friends of my mother's who, he believed, would cause her little, if any, unhappiness. But the woman he was commanded to take was an English lady named Sarah Noon, nearer my mother's age, who came over with the company of Saints in the same ship in which father and Brother Brigham returned from Europe. She had been married and was the mother of two little girls, but left her husband on account of his drunken and dissolute habits. Father was told to take her as his wife and provide for her and her children, and he did so. ~**Orson F. Whitney, Life of Heber C. Kimball, 336-337, Whitney writes in a footnote that Smith told Heber C. Kimball that if he did not do as he was told by Joseph he would “lose his Apostleship and be damned.”** 

I believe that Sarah Noon had a child by Heber in October, 1843 so she would have been sealed to Kimball in January, of 1842.

# Data and arguments against "eternity only"

## Josephine Lyon the daughter of Joseph Smith

In [an affidavit signed by her daughter Josephine](https://archive.org/details/AffidavitsOnCelestialMarriage/MS_3423_1-4/page/n53/mode/1up?view=theater), Sylvia Sessions---who was legally married to Windsor Lyon---told Josephine on her death bed that Joseph Smith was her father:

> Just prior to my mothers death in 1882 she called me to her bedside and told me that her days on earth were about numbered and before she passed away from mortality she desired to tell me something which she had kept as an entire secret from me and from all the others but which she now desired to communicate to me. She then told me that I was the daughter of the Prophet Joseph Smith, she having been sealed to the Prophet at the time that her husband Mr. Lyon was out of fellowship with the Church.

Whatever the nature of the marriage or sealing, the *prima facie* interpretation
is that Sylvia had a conjugal relationship with both Joseph Smith and Windsor
Lyon in close temporal proximity and argues against an "eternity only" style
relationship.

Hales [has argued](https://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/sylvia-sessions/) that a figurative/spiritual interpretation is possible:

> ... an eternity-only sealing between Sylvia and Joseph would have made Josephine his daughter in a spiritual sense automatically, since she was born-in-the-covenant of that sealing. Also, within the Church starting with the 1877 dedication of the St. George Temple, proxy sealings as vicarious adoption ordinances were creating fathers and daughters among individuals with no physical kinship relationship.

But then one wonders why such information would need to have been "kept as an
entire secret from me and from all the others" for Sylvia's entire life.
