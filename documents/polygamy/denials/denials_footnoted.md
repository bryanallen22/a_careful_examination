I've provided each of the denials which Hales lists in footnote #1 below, with a link to the text of each denial:

1. [May 26, 1844 sermon](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/d7c5c69a964bc10cd4a46d71e67c262ed86cba30/documents/polygamy/denials/1844-05-26-DENIAL-Address-of-the-Prophet--His-Testimony-Against-the-Dissenters-at-Nauvoo.pdf)

Hales includes several of the denials that I use (T&S Sept 1, 1842; "On Marriage" T&S Oct 1, 1842; May 26, 1844 Sermon).  However, he is missing the May 5, 1838 "Answers to Sundry Questions"; T&S April 15, 1842 Conference denial; August 31, 1842 Affidavits against Bennett; and the Oct 5, 1843 Journal entry.
