Martha Brotherton, who was maligned by Church leaders throughout the end of 1842 was sealed by proxy to Brigham Young in 1870.

From George Smith's book 'Nauvoo Polygamy:"â€¦ but we called it celestial marriage"' pp 271-272:

> Brotherton eventually returned to England, where she died in 1864. But on August 1, 1870, in Salt Lake City, Brigham Young achieved his romantic pursuit when he had Brotherton sealed to him for eternity. Her sister, Elizabeth Brotherton Pratt, plural wife of Apostle Parley Pratt, acted as proxy for the deceased.
