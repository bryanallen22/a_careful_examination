Why it was okay (according to apologists):

1. "Joseph made at least one attempt to teach the doctrine, but it was rejected"

2. "The Saints would have suffered negative consequences"

The contradiction:

To excuse Joseph, Brian Hales has said this:

> the fact is that under Illinois statute, he could truthfully answer negatively because state laws prevented any person from entering into more than one marriage.

However, if that is the case, then he cannot also use the same excuse to deny that he wasn't practicing adultery and fornication (is this FairMormon?):

> Since Joseph was sealed to his plural wives for either eternity, or for time and eternity, he did not view these relationships as constituting adultery or fornication. Therefore, under Illinois law, as long as Joseph and his plural wives did not live in an "open," or "public," manner, they were not guilty of breaking any civil law then in force in Illinois.

> Furthermore, this reality [that he was being accused of adultery] explains some of Joseph's public denials, since he could be truthfully said to not be guilty of the charges leveled against him: he was not committing adultery or fornication.


## The proper verbiage

In August of 1842, the Millenial Star wrote:

> a young female who emigrated from Manchester in September last, after conducting herself in a manner unworthy the character of one professing godliness, at length conceived the plan of gaining friendship and extraordinary notoriety with the world, or rather with the enemies of truth, by striking a blow at the character of some of its worthiest champions. She well knew that this would be received as a sweet morsel by her old friends, the Methodists, and other enemies of the Saints. She accordingly selected president J. [Joseph] Smith, and elder B. [Brigham] Young for her victims, and **wrote to England that these men had been trying to seduce her, by making her believe that God had given a revelation that men might have two wives**; by these disreputable means she thought to overthrow the Saints here, or at least to bring a storm of persecution on them, and prevent others from joining them; but in this thing **she was completely deceived by Satan**.

To discredit this young female, The Millenial Star then published letter from her sister claiming that "my sister has told some of the greatest lies that ever were circulated" and "she and many other of the English Saints have proved that the statements made by my sister are falsehoods of the basest kind".

If she had been mistaken, then the Saints felt it appropriate to publish that this young female was guilty of telling "some of the greatest lies that ever were circulated"
