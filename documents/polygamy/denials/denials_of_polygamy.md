# The denials

## Denials from Joseph Smith directly

We have good records of Joseph Smith stating (or strongly implying) that having more than one wife was not then occurring and/or was unacceptable.

### October 5, 1843

Joseph's [journal entry for the day](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/4a1e6af8ca63214675784b3055c1c17eb8412013/documents/polygamy/oct5-1843/october-5th-journal-entry.pdf) (originally) said:

> Evening at home and walked up and down the street with my scribe.  Gave inst[r]uction to try those who were preaching teaching or practicing the doctrine of plurality of wives. on this Law. Joseph forbids it. and the practice ther[e]ofâ€” No man shall have but one wife.

### Apologetic excuses

Why it was okay (according to apologists):

1. They were exploiting technical loopholes.
2. "Joseph made at least one attempt to teach the doctrine, but it was rejected"
3. "The Saints would have suffered negative consequences"
