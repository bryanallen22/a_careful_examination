The possibility exists given that Bennett was in St. Louis while she was there.
No direct evidence exists that Bennett ever met Brotherton or influenced her
affidavit.  

Bennett is a complicated source.  On some level, it is clear that he had access to inside information that has been verified by scholars over time (for instance, he was able to indicate by initials many of Joseph's early polygamous wives).  At the same time, [he was a serial adulterer](http://mormonpolygamydocuments.org/john-c-bennett-joseph-smiths-polygamy-addressing-question-reliability/), and [it is difficult to interpret many of his statements as anything but lies](https://archive.org/stream/jmormhist.42.3.0094#page/n1/mode/1up).  So, there are very good reasons to consider Bennett a compromised and untrustworthy source, generally.

Martha had been a faithful Saint, emigrating from England with her family to settle in Nauvoo.  There can be little doubt that a genuine proposition event triggered Martha to tell her parents, causing them to spread news of the proposition among the Saints and that would convince them to leave Nauvoo even though they would leave two sisters behind.

"No sin where there was no accuser" argument?


“…if we did not accuse one another God would not accuse us & if we had no accuser we should enter heaven. He [Joseph] would take us there as his backload. If we would not accuse him [Joseph] he would not accuse us & if we would throw a cloak of charity over his sins he would over ours. For charity coverd a multitude of Sins & what many people called sin was not sin & he did many things to break down superstition & he would break it down. He spoke of the curse of Ham for laughing at Noah while in his wine but doing no harm.” (Source: Wilford Woodruff’s Journal, Vol. 2, 1841–1845, p.137, November 7, 1841, emphasis mine.)
