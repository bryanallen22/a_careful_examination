Nauvoo March 15, 1844. To the brethren of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints living on China Creek, in Hancock County, Greeting:---Whereas Brother Richard Hewitt has called on me to-day, to know my views concerning some doctrines that are preached in your place, and states to me that some of your elders say, that a man _having a certain priesthood_, may have as many wives as he pleases, and that doctrine is taught here: I say unto you that that man teaches _false doctrine_, for there is no such doctrine taught here; neither is there any such thing practised here.  And any man that is found teaching privately or publicly any such doctrine, is culpable, and will stand a chance to be brought before the High Council, and lose his license and membership also: therefore he had better beware what he is about. 

...

In the bonds of the everlasting covenant,

I am

Your obedient servant,

HYRUM SMITH
