> Despite criticisms charging that Joseph lied when denying polygamy, the fact is that under Illinois statute, he could truthfully answer negatively because state laws prevented any person from entering into more than one marriage. A second (or third or forth) marriage could not be certified with any legal document. Hence practicing legal polygamy was an impossibility.

Then, according to the law, he was practicing adultery (note that only "open"
adultery was illegal at the time, but the behavior would still have been
classified as legally adulterous).

> The 1827 Illinois State anti-bigamy law reads: “All marriages, where either of the parties had a former husband or wife living at the time of solemnizing the last marriage, shall be void” (italics added).

Again, if these marriages are not valid, then they were practicing adultery and could be accused of such.  However, every statement we have of these women regarding these marriages suggests they considered them "marriages" and that they were Joseph Smith's "wives".

> Consequently, legally speaking it was impossible for Joseph Smith or any other Nauvoo pluralist to truthfully answer “yes” to the question: “Do you have more than one wife?”

The denials cover far more ground than just the question of the legality of the practice.  The women understood these to be marriages and that they were each a wife.

> The answer depends upon the definition of the word “polygamy.” To him, “celestial marriage” was an “order of the priesthood” that was essentially unrelated to the polygamy practices of the Turks in the Islamic world, with their harems and concubines. Therefore, it is unlikely the Prophet would have equated his teachings of “patriarchal marriage” and “eternal marriage” with their traditions.

Hales offers no evidence that Joseph Smith ever thought this way.  In addition, Muslims would object to this characterization of their practice of polygamy ([example](http://www.islamawareness.net/Polygamy/fatwa004.html)).  Islam (typically) limits polygamy to *4* wives, and they justify it in similarly as Joseph did (i.e., Abraham, David, and Solomon practiced it, so it was something that a prophet *could* justly do).  Given that Joseph married and then did not afford his wives housing and equal societal respect given his first wife, it is curious that Hales would use the terms "harems and concubines" to describe Islamic polygamy (Muhammed only had 11 wives, and again, the Quran limits polygamy to 4 women) and not the marriages of Joseph and Brigham to approximately **100** women, most of whom were not well cared for and many of which were never granted societal recognition for their relationship.

> John L. Brooke concluded: “A deceptive code developed, allowing the leadership to condemn ‘polygamy, in the ordinary and Asiatic sense of the term,’ while defending ‘the Holy order of celestial marriage,’ ‘the true and divine order,’ and the ‘new and everlasting covenant.’”

John L. Brooke considered it "deceptive".

> Accordingly, Joseph Smith could have truthfully answered “no” to the question: “Are you practicing legal polygamy or polygamy like Arab Muslims?” For example, on May 26, 1844, he commented: “What a thing it is for a man to be accused of committing adultery, and having seven wives, when I can only find one.” If Joseph had looked diligently, could he have found additional legal wives?  No. Could he have found additional wives according to Islamic traditions? No. He might have asked for the questioner to be more specific, and then the answer necessarily have been in the affirmative.

We have no evidence that Joseph ever thought about Islamic polygamy in this manner.  Regardless, if he were answer with these "codes" in mind, he was equivocating (which is a type of lie) and clearly deceiving his listeners (a "lie" according to the Gospel Principles manual).
