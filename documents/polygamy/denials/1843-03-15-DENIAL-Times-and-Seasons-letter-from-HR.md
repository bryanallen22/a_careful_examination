John Taylor was [editor of the Times and Seasons](http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/9200), was in [Joseph's inner circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anointed_Quorum), and [had likely been taught about polygamy by this time](http://www.lds-mormon.com/quinn_dialogue.shtml).  Taylor would take his first polygamous wife [by the end of the 1843](https://restorationbookstore.org/articles/nopoligamy/jsfp-vol2/2chp17.htm).

Mr. Editor, SIR---

...

We are charged with advocating a plurality of wives, and common property. Now this is as false as the many other ridiculous charges which are brought against us. No sect have a greater reverence for the laws of matrimony, or the rights of private property, and we do what others do not, practice what we preach ...

...

I remain, sir, your obliged servant, H. R.
