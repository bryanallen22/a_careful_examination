I compiled a list of dates from Brian and Laura Hales (LDS apologists) Joseph Smith's Polygamy [Biographies of Josephâ€™s Plural Wives](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/) page and extracted sealing or marriage dates from each biography (extraction performed February 23, 2017). To easily calculate the wife count and list given a specific date see [`joseph_smtih_wife_count_calculator.rb`](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/main/scripts/joseph_smith_wife_count_calculator.rb).

Notes:

* Emma Hale was not listed in the Hales' list, so that information is from elsewhere.  I included the commonly accepted marriage and sealing dates for Emma.
* For spring I have substituted the month of July and summer the month of October.
* Where there was any question about the date, the date errs as *late* as is conceivably possible.  Where two equally likely dates are available, the first was chosen.
