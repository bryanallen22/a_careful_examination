# Who had sex with Joseph Smith?

Given testimony and evidence, with which women can we reasonably infer that Joseph Smith had sex?

The list follows with the age at marriage and the evidence indicating a sexual relationship.

* (17) Lucy Walker: "Shortly afterwards I consented to become the Prophet’s wife, and was married to him May 1, 1843, Elder William Clayton officiating. I am also able to testify that Emma Smith, the Prophet’s first wife, gave her consent to the marriage of at least four other girls to her husband, and that she was well aware that he associated with them as wives within the meaning of all that word implies."
* (19) Emily Partridge: "said she 'roomed' with Joseph the night following her marriage to him, and said that she had 'carnal intercourse' with him. (also from Lucy Walker's statement)
* (22) Eliza Partridge: based on deduction from Lucy Walker's statement.
* (17) Sarah Lawrence: based on deduction from Lucy Walker's statement.
* (19) Maria Lawrence: based on deduction from Lucy Walker's statement.
* (19) Melissa Lott Willes: "had been Smith's wife 'in very deed'" (ISL)

Mormon Enigma identifies the 4 individuals Emma consented to as Emily and Eliza Partridge and Sarah and Maria Lawrence. ([source](http://www.mrm.org/did-emma-smith-ever-approve-of-polygamy))

The ages of the women we suspect he had sex with were: 17 (2), 19 (3), 22 (1).
