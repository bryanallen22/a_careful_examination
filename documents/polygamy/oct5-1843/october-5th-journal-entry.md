Summary: The original journal entry that had Joseph forbidding polygamy and wanting to try people for practicing or teaching it was altered by later Church historians or leaders in order to countenance polygamy.

Joseph Smith's [journal entry from October 5, 1843](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1842-june-1844-book-3-15-july-1843-29-february-1844/123) reads:

> Thursday October 5. ... eve at home walked up and down st. with scribe.— and gave instruction to try those who were preaching teaching or the doctrin of plurality of wives. on this Law. Joseph forbids it. and the practice thereof— No man shall have but one wife

The [manuscript] History Draft includes a statement "to be revised" in the margin, and the original draft (in the pen of Thomas Bullock, I believe) was altered[^alterations] somewhat drastically ([JS Papers link](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-draft-1-march-31-december-1843/143); [image with red bounding box](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/d6ee663e933a8cb01b79ddc33fe1232ac3ef12e5/documents/polygamy/oct5-1843/original-journal-entry-anonymous.jpg)):

> Evening at home, and walked up and down the streets with my scribe. Gave instructions to try those persons who were preaching, teaching, or practicing the doctrine of plurality of wives; ~~on this~~ ~~on this law~~ **for according to the law I hold the keys of this power in the last days, for there is never but one on Earth at a time on whom the power and its keys are conferred---and I have constantly said** ~~Joseph forbids it and the practice thereof.~~  No man shall have but one wife **at a time unless the Lord directs otherwise**.

Finally, the text [as it appears in the final draft](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-e-1-1-july-1843-30-april-1844/118) ([image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/d6ee663e933a8cb01b79ddc33fe1232ac3ef12e5/documents/polygamy/oct5-1843/manuscript-history-of-the-church-october-5-1843-d1-720px.jpg)) includes all the alterations:

> Evening, at home, and walked up and down the Streets with my scribe. Gave instructions to try those persons who were preaching, teaching, or practicing the doctrine of plurality of wives; for according to the law I hold the keys of this power in the last days, for there is never but one on Earth at a time on whom the power and its keys are conferred— and I have constantly said no man shall have but one wife at a time, unless the Lord directs otherwise.

The final print version, found in [History of the Church 6:2 as published at BYU Studies](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-6-chapter-2), reads:

> Evening, at home, and walked up and down the streets with my scribe. Gave instructions to try those persons who were preaching, teaching, or practicing the doctrine of plurality of wives: for, according to the law, I hold the keys of this power in the last days; for there is never but one on earth at a time on whom the power and its keys are conferred; _and I have constantly said no man shall have but one wife at a time, unless the Lord directs otherwise._

Notes on possible interpretations of this event:

1. Smith was honest and later leaders were **not** honest - Joseph Smith was not lying and later leaders of the Church altered the meaning of Joseph's words to contravene their original meaning.
2. Smith was **not** honest and later leaders were honest - Joseph was prevaricating and later leaders of the Church altered the meaning of Joseph's words to fit with Joseph's original *intent* (i.e., polygamy was okay in certain circumstances).
3. Smith was **not** honest and later leaders were **not** honest - Joseph Smith lied about polygamy and later leaders dishonestly altered the meaning of Smith's deceitful statement.
4. Smith was honest and later leaders were honest - Joseph was issuing a *tactical* mandate ([described here](http://www.millennialstar.org/commentary-on-joseph-smiths-monogamy/)).

[^alterations]: George A. Smith, the person responsible for dictating this portion of the manuscript history from original source material [noted](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/intro/introduction-to-history-drafts-1844-1856) "The History has been compiled to the day of his [JS’s] death and the principal part of it has been revised by the Council of the First Presidency almost without any alteration. ..."  I did my own cursory analysis of the handwriting and think it may match up to John L. Smith's?  Benjamin G. Bistline [attributes the change to George A. Smith](https://books.google.com/books?id=xKz-wcizZXEC&lpg=PA163&ots=GfsIXUIKvS&dq=%22Joseph%20forbids%20it%22%20No%20man%20shall%20have%20but%20one%20wife&pg=PA163#v=onepage&q=%22Joseph%20forbids%20it%22%20No%20man%20shall%20have%20but%20one%20wife&f=false).
