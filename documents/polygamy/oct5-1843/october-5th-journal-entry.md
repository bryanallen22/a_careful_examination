Summary: The original journal entry that had Joseph forbidding polygamy and wanting to try people for practicing or teaching it was drastically altered by later Church historians to countenance polygamy.

Joseph Smith's Journal entry from the 5th of October 1843 reads:

> Gave inst[r]uction to try those who were preaching teaching or practicing the doctrine of plurality of wives. on this Law. Joseph forbids it. and the practice ther[e]ofâ€” No man shall have but one wife.

Possible interpretations of this event:

1. Smith was honest and later leaders were **not** honest - Joseph Smith was not lying and later leaders of the Church altered the meaning of Joseph's words to contravene their original meaning.
3. Smith was **not** honest and later leaders were honest - Joseph was prevaricating and later leaders of the Church altered the meaning of Joseph's words to fit with Joseph's original *intent* (i.e., polygamy was okay in certain circumstances).
4. Smith was **not** honest and later leaders were **not** honest - Joseph Smith lied about polygamy and later leaders dishonestly altered the meaning of Smith's deceitful statement.
4. Smith was honest and later leaders were honest - Joseph was issuing a *tactical* mandate ([described here](http://www.millennialstar.org/commentary-on-joseph-smiths-monogamy/)).
