Summary: The original journal entry that had Joseph forbidding polygamy and wanting to try people for practicing or teaching it was altered by later Church historians or leaders in order to countenance polygamy.

Joseph Smith's [journal entry from October 5, 1843](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1842-june-1844-book-3-15-july-1843-29-february-1844/123) reads:

> Thursday October 5. ... eve at home walked up and down st. with scribe.— and gave instruction to try those who were preaching teaching or the doctrin of plurality of wives. on this Law. Joseph forbids it. and the practice thereof— No man shall have but one wife

The [manuscript] History Draft includes a statement "to be revised" in the margin, and the original draft (in the pen of Thomas Bullock, I believe) was altered[^alterations] somewhat drastically ([JS Papers link](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-draft-1-march-31-december-1843/143); [image with red bounding box](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/d6ee663e933a8cb01b79ddc33fe1232ac3ef12e5/documents/polygamy/oct5-1843/original-journal-entry-anonymous.jpg)):

> Evening at home, and walked up and down the streets with my scribe. Gave instructions to try those persons who were preaching, teaching, or practicing the doctrine of plurality of wives; ~~on this~~ ~~on this law~~ **for according to the law I hold the keys of this power in the last days, for there is never but one on Earth at a time on whom the power and its keys are conferred---and I have constantly said** ~~Joseph forbids it and the practice thereof.~~  No man shall have but one wife **at a time unless the Lord directs otherwise**.

Finally, the text [as it appears in the final draft](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-e-1-1-july-1843-30-april-1844/118) ([image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/d6ee663e933a8cb01b79ddc33fe1232ac3ef12e5/documents/polygamy/oct5-1843/manuscript-history-of-the-church-october-5-1843-d1-720px.jpg)) includes all the alterations:

> Evening, at home, and walked up and down the Streets with my scribe. Gave instructions to try those persons who were preaching, teaching, or practicing the doctrine of plurality of wives; for according to the law I hold the keys of this power in the last days, for there is never but one on Earth at a time on whom the power and its keys are conferred— and I have constantly said no man shall have but one wife at a time, unless the Lord directs otherwise.

The final print version, found in [History of the Church 6:2 as published at BYU Studies](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-6-chapter-2), reads:

> Evening, at home, and walked up and down the streets with my scribe. Gave instructions to try those persons who were preaching, teaching, or practicing the doctrine of plurality of wives: for, according to the law, I hold the keys of this power in the last days; for there is never but one on earth at a time on whom the power and its keys are conferred; _and I have constantly said no man shall have but one wife at a time, unless the Lord directs otherwise._

### Interpretation

There are many ways to interpret the original entry and the later changes (some involving dishonesty of one or more parties).  Meg Stout has advanced the [tactical mandate hypothesis](http://www.millennialstar.org/commentary-on-joseph-smiths-monogamy/).

### Joseph Fielding Smith attestation

In the book [Blood Atonement and the Origin of Plural Marriage](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50535), Joseph Fielding Smith corresponded with Richard G. Evans, second counselor in the Presidency of the RLDS Church:

> You "confidently affirm that there is not a single word in a single sermon, lecture, statement, newspaper or Church publication printed during the life of Joseph Smith, wherein he by word has endorsed the doctrine of plurality of wives, not a single statement." Whether any such statement was ever printed in his lifetime or not I am not prepared to say. But I do know of such evidence being recorded during his lifetime, for I have seen it.

> I have copied the following from the Prophet's manuscript record of Oct. 5, 1843, and know it is genuine:

> > "Gave instructions to try those persons who were preaching, teaching or practicing the doctrine of plurality of wives; for according to the law, I hold the keys of this power in the last days; for there is never but one on earth at a time on whom this power and its keys are conferred; and I have constantly said no man shall have but one wife at a time unless the Lord directs otherwise."

Given that the original entry does not contain the verbiage Joseph Fielding Smith refers to, it seems that he was either mistaken about the source he was reading from or was deliberately misleading.

[^alterations]: George A. Smith, the person responsible for dictating this portion of the manuscript history from original source material [noted](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/intro/introduction-to-history-drafts-1844-1856) "The History has been compiled to the day of his [JS’s] death and the principal part of it has been revised by the Council of the First Presidency almost without any alteration. ..."  I did my own cursory analysis of the handwriting and think it may match up to John L. Smith's?  Benjamin G. Bistline [attributes the change to George A. Smith](https://books.google.com/books?id=xKz-wcizZXEC&lpg=PA163&ots=GfsIXUIKvS&dq=%22Joseph%20forbids%20it%22%20No%20man%20shall%20have%20but%20one%20wife&pg=PA163#v=onepage&q=%22Joseph%20forbids%20it%22%20No%20man%20shall%20have%20but%20one%20wife&f=false).
