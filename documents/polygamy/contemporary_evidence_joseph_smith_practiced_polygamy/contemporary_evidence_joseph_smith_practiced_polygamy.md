### Introduction

Joseph Smith made *many* public denials that he was practicing polygamy (see [Hales's analysis](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/common-questions/polygamy-denials/) and [my analysis]({{ "/joseph-smith-polygamy-denials/" | relative_url }})).  In an effort to exonerate him, some take him at his word and claim that polygamy (with an emphasis on marriage during time) was a later invention of Brigham Young and other LDS leadership.[^examples_of_polygamy_deniers]

However, some *contemporary* evidence exists that Joseph Smith practiced polygamy.

### Oliver Cowdery

1. Oliver Cowdery wrote a letter to his brother discussing Joseph's "scrape" with Fanny Alger:

    [Oliver Cowdery's letter to Warren A. Cowdery, Jan 21, 1838](https://imgur.com/UXN9wpv).

1. Oliver Cowdery's excommunication trial was [recorded in Joseph Smith's journal](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-march-september-1838/16#full-transcript).  The second charge was for insinuating that JS had committed adultery:[^cowdery]

    > Charge prefered against O[liver] Cowdery before the high Council in Far West Mo.— by Elder Seymour Brounson [Brunson], To the Bishop and Council of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, [p. 29] I do hereby prefer the following Charges against Oliver Cowdery, which consists of nine in number. ...  2nd For seeking to destroy the Character of Pres. Joseph Smith Jr by falsly insinuating that he was guilty of adultery &c. ... 

### D&C 132

[D&C 132, received 12 July 1843](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-12-july-1843-dc-132/1)

* Mormon Stories episode 1797 ([notes](https://web.archive.org/web/20230812234615/https://www.mormonstories.org/podcast/joseph-smith-polygamy-rfm/), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH0fILAzdno)) : Radio Free Mormon argues that the affidavits in the Nauvoo Expositor recapitulate all material aspects of D&C 132 and hence demonstrate that it existed at the time of the Expositor's publication.

* Brian Hales discusses [the provenance of Joseph C. Kingsbury's copy of D&C 132](https://mormonpolygamydocuments.org/provenance-dc-132-documented/).

### Sarah Ann Whitney documents

A trio of primary documents, all signed or in Joseph Smith's hand, implicate him in plural marriage with Sarah Ann Whitney.  The three documents together are difficult to explain outside the context of a plural marriage.

1. [Blessing to Sarah Ann Whitney](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/blessing-to-sarah-ann-whitney-23-march-1843/1) [in Joseph Smith's hand] Sarah turned 18 the day before.
2. [Deed to Sarah Ann Whitney](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/deed-to-sarah-ann-whitney-6-september-1842/1) [signed by Joseph Smith] Sarah was 17 years old at the time of this deed.
3. [Letter to the Whitneys](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-newel-k-elizabeth-ann-smith-and-sarah-ann-whitney-18-august-1842/1) [in Joseph Smith's hand] Sarah was 17 years old at the time.

### Malissa Lott's marriage recorded in Family Bible

Joseph Smith's journal entry for Sept 20, 1843, recorded by Willard Richards, indicated that JS rode out to his farm. On that day, Hyrum Smith sealed Cornelius Lott (who managed Joseph Smith's farm) to Permelia Darrow "with seal of Presadent Joseph Smith." The Lott family Bible contains an entry, "Sept the 20 CP Lott and Permelia Lott gave their Dauter [sic] Malisa to wife." She is listed in an entry further along in the Marriages registry at the time of her second marriage in 1847 in that Bible as "Malisa _Smith_." Footnote 200 of JS Papers suggests that JS was "married or sealed" on that date as well "...though primary sources identifying the date of JS and Malissa Lott’s sealing are either incomplete or contradictory." In any event, separate documents from that time showing no evidence of tampering from what I can tell position JS in the right location for a marriage/sealing with Malisa Lott.

### Land deeds

As reported by Bill Reel (would like to validate this) ~75% of the land deeds
to women in Nauvoo between 1842 and 1843 corresponded to alleged plural wives
of Joseph Smith. Listed below are the deeds and ages of the women at the time
of the deed grant (as compiled by Bill Reel):

### Nauvoo High Council Minutes

See outline in **part E** of [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/144ahjo/the_evidence_laid_out_that_joseph_smith_was_the/) by Bill Reel.

Leonard Soby was at the August 12, 1843 High Council meeting where polygamy was introduced.  Given that his rejection of the revelation led to his excommunication, [his testimony](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/5d9pa1/leonard_soby_18061892_converted_to_mormonism_and/) seems especially relevant because he cannot be said to be biased by any possible later LDS conspiracy.

### Letter from Jedediah M. Grant to Joseph Smith

A letter from Jedediah M. Grant to Joseph Smith in August of 1843 implies an
invitation from Joseph Smith to Susan Conrad to accept---and also encodes news
of Hyrum Smith's acceptance of---the doctrine of plural marriage.

See William V. Smith's article in [Dialogue Winter 2016](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/articles/a-documentary-note-on-a-letter-to-joseph-smith-romance-death-and-polygamy-the-life-and-times-of-susan-hough-conrad-and-lorenzo-dow-barnes/) which includes a transcript of the letter.

### Martha Brotherton's affidavit (potential antagonistic bias)

Joseph and Hyrum Smith denied rumors of a proposal to Martha Brotherton [in the April 6, 1842 general conference](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/times-and-seasons-apr-15-1842-conference-minutes/).

After Bennett left Nauvoo, he solicited an affidavit from Brotherton.  [Martha Brotherton's affidavit](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/martha-brotherton-affidavit/) runs somewhat counter to many of the claims Bennett was making in his book and is fairly consistent with later testimony evidence of both the rationale advanced and the *modus operandi* for proposals that came from Latter-day Saint participants.[^hales_uses_brotherton]

### Buckeye's laments (antagonistic bias)

An insider to Nauvoo polygamy wrote two exposés on Joseph Smith's polygamy in the Warsaw Message and then Warsaw Signal (same paper, just a change of names).  Bergera discusses the articles [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20100707004021/http://dig.lib.niu.edu/ISHS/ishs-2002winter/ishs-2002winter350.pdf).

[^cowdery]: Joseph Smith Papers editors provide [the following footnote](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-march-september-1838/16#12364309435905554968) after Cowdery's charge that Smith was guilty of adultery:

    > Testimony from George W. Harris, David W. Patten, and Thomas B. Marsh confirmed that Cowdery had made such insinuations about JS’s relationship in Kirtland with a young woman named Fanny Alger. At the trial, JS stated that as Cowdery “had been his bosom friend, therefore he intrusted him with many things”—apparently confirming the reality of a confidential relationship with Alger. JS then “gave a history respecting the girl business.” This history may have regarded the origins of the Mormon practice of polygamy. Revelation claimed by JS sanctioning the polygyny practiced by Old Testament patriarchs was evidently related to JS’s 1831 work on revision of the Bible. Kirtland Mormons, including Alger’s family, viewed the relationship as an early plural marriage. Nevertheless, an estranged Cowdery insisted on characterizing the relationship as “a dirty, nasty, filthy affair of his and Fanny Alger’s.”  (Minute Book 2, 12 Apr. 1838.Bachman, “Ohio Origins of the Revelation on Eternal Marriage”; Compton, In Sacred Loneliness, 27. Oliver Cowdery, Far West, MO, to Warren Cowdery, [Kirtland, OH], 21 Jan. 1838, in Cowdery, Letterbook, 80–83; see also Parkin, “Conflict at Kirtland,” 128–135.)

[^examples_of_polygamy_deniers]: A few notable examples of those suggesting that Joseph either did not practice polygamy or only very reluctantly practiced it, which typically involves a conspiracy theory led by Brigham Young and the Brighamite branch of the Church:

    * The Price's, RLDS researchers, published several volumes arguing that JS fought polygamy (e.g., [volume 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20170719175327/http://restorationbookstore.org:80/articles/nopoligamy/jsfp-vol2/2chp1.htm))
    * The site [Hemlock Knots](https://hemlockknots.com/) contains [a detailed timeline of polygamy documents](https://hemlockknots.com/monogamy-polygamy-timeline/) and is meant to allow visitors to weigh the raw, historical data as to whether JS practiced polygamy.
