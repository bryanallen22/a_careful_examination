1. The pattern of conception of Joseph's children with Emma suggests his
   ability to control impregnation generally.

    Joseph had eight children with Emma.  D. Michael Quinn points out [in
    Early Mormonism and the Magic World
    View](https://preview.redd.it/bx53sy00kvj61.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=85422f8a32fe86b55d2415b594cb51dca440d25c)
    that "all of Smith's children were conceived in either February or
    September" corresponding to what Quinn suggests was a belief that in these
    months sexual generation was governed by Smith's ruling planet Jupiter.

    His apparent ability to control the month of conception for all eight
    children with his first wife Emma suggests that he was capable of
    controlling impregnation generally.[^temporal_pregnancy]

1. Joseph was likely not having much sex with his plural wives in comparison to Emma.

    * Some of his wives were kicked out of his home by Emma (Fanny Alger, Eliza Partridge, Emily Partridge) thus likely terminating any potential sexual relationships with these women.
    * Emma was a limiting factor in access to Joseph (Emily Partridge [stated](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/common-questions/plural-marriages-sexual/emily-dow-partridge-evidence-of-sexuality/): "Emma knew that we were married to him, but she never allowed us to live with him" and the [letter to Sarah Ann Whitney](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/sarah-ann-whitney/): "the only thing to be careful of; is to find out when Emma [Smith] comes then you cannot be safe, but when she is not here, there is the most perfect safty")
    * Since polygamy was not widely acknowledged, Joseph had to keep liasons secretive in general, and this was described as difficult (e.g., [Sarah Ann Whitney letter](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/sarah-ann-whitney/): "only be careful to escape observation, as much as possible")
    * Emily Partridge [testified](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/common-questions/plural-marriages-sexual/emily-dow-partridge-evidence-of-sexuality/) that she slept in the same bed with Joseph "Only one night" although her testimony seems to indicate sexual intercourse on some other occasions.
    * An examination of [his marriage timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Joseph_Smith%27s_wives) suggests that, at times, he was marrying one or more new plural wives every few weeks.  It is difficult to imagine anyone having sustained sexual relationships with any given wife under such circumstances.

        Brian Hales [wrote](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/common-questions/plural-marriages-sexual/):

        > An important consideration is the phenomenon of diminishing returns. After a certain point, the addition of new plural wives did not necessarily increase Joseph’s opportunity for additional sexual encounters with each plural wife. **Such a dynamic would, inevitably, have curtailed chances for conception on the part of his plural wives.**

1. Various birth control methods, including withdrawal, may have been used.

    * Use of and instructions on how to make a rubber condom [was becoming widespread in the 1840s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_condoms#18th_century).
    * A variety of birth control methods [were being published in the early 1800s](http://artsci.case.edu/dittrick/online-exhibits/history-of-birth-control/contraception-in-america-1800-1900/early-literature/), including withdrawal.

1. Abortion was somewhat common in that era and surgical abortion not illegal in Illinois at the time.  A known practicioner of abortion was in Joseph Smith's close inner circle in Nauvoo for some time.

    Lauren MacIvor Thompson [summarized the data on abortion](https://www.civilwarmed.org/birth-control/) in that era:

    > Abortions were also readily included in the universe of Civil War era birth control. Though the practice was never without controversy, abortion was legal in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries until the moment of “quickening,” when the pregnant woman could feel fetal movement. While exact statistics are difficult to calculate, we do know that abortion rates rose steadily between 1830-1860, to one in five pregnancies. The most common means included the women’s ingestion of abortifacient drugs, as well as abortions performed with surgical instruments by trained practitioners (who weren’t always physicians).

    Illinois was the first state to criminalize prequickening abortion in
    1827, but this statue only outlawed "potional" (injesting substances)
    abortion (see pg 1784 of [Criminal Abortion
    Revisited](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/2174/) by
    Samuel Buell).

    Smith may have used John C. Bennett's services or he or someone in Nauvoo perhaps learned to perform abortions from him (see Hale's LDS apologetic/scholarly perspective [here](http://mormonpolygamydocuments.org/abortions/)).  Evidence supports the fact that Bennett was practicing abortion and that he could cover up a trail of philandery using it. Sarah Pratt claimed Bennett practiced abortion on some of Joseph Smith's plural wives, but most LDS scholars discount her testimony due to possible exaggeration and inconsistencies in it. It is important to note that Bennett was only around Joseph Smith for [some of the time he was engaged in plural marriage](https://lecturesondoubt.com/2019/03/27/top-6-exmormon-myths/), but as explained above, abortions were not always conducted by physicians, and it's possible Bennett trained others in the practice before his departure.
    
    Some LDS scholars also discount the abortion hypothesis because, they say, it would make Joseph look hypocritical since he taught that celestial marriage was for the purpose of raising up seed.  However, given his sealing to a 7 month pregnant woman, Zina Diantha Huntington Jacobs, it is reasonable to suggest that raising up seed was not always an immediate concern in his practice of polygamy.

1. All of the various possible descendants have not yet been tested for paternity yet.

    Genetic tests have been confirmed to rule out paternity for the seven most
    likely candidates.

    The Deseret News [summarized Ugo Perego's presentation](https://www.deseret.com/2016/6/13/20590178/joseph-smith-apparently-was-not-josephine-lyon-s-father-mormon-history-association-speaker-says):

    > In the past, seven sons (Orrison Smith, Moroni Pratt, Zebulon Jacobs, Mosiah Hancock, Oliver Buell, John Hancock and Don Alonzo Smith) were ascribed to Joseph Smith through polygamous unions. Negative findings resulted after DNA testing was employed to reconstruct Joseph Smith’s male Y chromosome signature and to compare it to the Y chromosome of male descendants of the alleged sons.

    However, Hales assembled a list of potential progeny [Allegations of Joseph's Paternity](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Possible-Children-chart.jpg), and [a 2007 article](https://www.deseret.com/2007/11/10/20052616/dna-tests-rule-out-2-as-smith-descendants), also summarizing Perego's work, states that "approximately 12 people [were] alleged to have been Smith's children."

    In fact, Don Bradley recently (December 24, 2018) [claimed that he had identified a child of Joseph Smith by polygamy](https://imgur.com/HK3z6gx) and is currently doing Y-chromosomal testing to confirm or falsify his hypothesis.

1. For the polyandrous unions, Joseph may have been competing for fertilization with an existing married partner

    For some of Smith's polyandrous marriages, the paternity of his children was unclear to the mother.  For instance, Sylvia Sessions told her daughter Josephine [that she was sired by Joseph Smith](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Question:_Did_Joseph_Smith_produce_any_children_by_his_plural_wives:_The_case_for_children), but it turns out she was not fathered by Smith.  This strongly indicates that Sessions was sleeping with Smith and her legal husband in close temporal proximity.

1. For the polyandrous unions, if a woman is already pregnant, then she cannot cannot become pregnant again.

    For instance, Zina Huntington Jacobs was [7 months pregnant](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/zina-diantha-huntington/) when she was sealed to Joseph Smith.  If they consummated their sealing at that time, then she could not have become pregnant.

### Discussion

Until/unless progeny via a polygamous reliationship is discovered, it is difficult to know with absolute certainty that Joseph Smith was having sex with anyone except Emma.  Still, as discussed above, a variety of possibilities exist to help potentially account for Joseph Smith not impregnating his plural wives.  Regardless of direct DNA evidence from progeny, [significant first-hand testimony exists that Joseph did have sex with many of his wives]({{ "/evidence-of-sex-in-joseph-smith-polygamy/" | relative_url }}).  In addition, other early practioners of polygamy---who were introduced to the practice by Joseph Smith---were impregnating their wives (e.g., Brigham Young), so we have good reason to believe that Joseph's polygamy was not practiced in radically different terms (i.e., completely asexual).
