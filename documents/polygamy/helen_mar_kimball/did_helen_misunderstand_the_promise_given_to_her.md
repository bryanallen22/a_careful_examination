## Introduction

In her [1881 autobiographical
letter][helen-mar-kimball-whitney-1881-autobiography], Helen Mar
Kimball wrote:

> I heard him [Joseph Smith] teach and explain the principle of celestial
> marriage. After which he said to me, “If you will take this step, it will
> ensure your eternal salvation and exaltation and that of your father’s
> household and all of your kindred.” This promise was so great that I
> willingly gave myself to purchase so glorious a reward.

Brian Hales has argued that Helen's 
Brian Hales [argued against the
idea](https://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/helen-mar-kimball/)
that this is "solid evidence that the Prophet promised exaltation to at least
one of his plural wives and her family if they would agree to the marriage"
because:

> ... one year later Helen clarified that she may not have understood everything correctly: “I confess that I was too young or too ‘foolish’ to comprehend and appreciate all” that Joseph Smith then taught.

[quotes from family]

### Sarah Ann Whitney blessing

Conditionals in italics, unconditional statements in bold.

> Joseph Smith <br/>

### Dramatic reversal of position

[discuss how HMK was very non-plussed about the situation and what Joseph
Smith said was a huge turning point in her mind.  Did she really misunderstand or did
Joseph oversell it?]

### Why we do not marry 14 year olds

[If Hales's argument is correct, then this is a great reason not to marry 14
year olds (regardless of whether you have sex with them)!]

[Why didn't Joseph postpone the marriage?  What was the rush??]

[Best case, the wishes of the father superseceded the serious concerns of the
daughter and difficulty appreciating the theology.  Worst case, Joseph wanted
to marry her for power or sexuality, either to be realized immediately or
perhaps deferred until she was older]
