## Henry Jacobs

Some bring up Henry Jacobs.  Jacobs was not sent on a mission before the sealing, but he was sent on a mission within three months of Joseph's sealing to Zina.

### Timeline

* **October 1841** - Smith wrote to Zina: "put it off till an angel with a drawn sword stood by me and told me if I did not establish that principle [plurality of wives] upon the earth I would lose my position and my life."
