## The primary focus of the sealing ceremony in its first 2 years was to enable polygamy

The vast majority of early sealings were polygamous sealings (_in stead of_ a sealing to an existing civil wife).  The exceptions were still tightly associated with prior acceptance of or enabling a polygamous sealing.

Data assembled from Table 1 and Table 2 of Gary Bergera's article [The Earliest Eternal Sealings for Civilly Married Couples Living and Dead](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V35N03_49.pdf)

\* The polygamous sealing is thought to have preceded or coincided with the civil marriage sealing.

† This sealing was performed as reward for enabling the polygamous sealing
of Joseph to their daughter

‡ Joseph Smith preemptively sealed himself to Orson Hyde's civil wife.

The data clearly show that the initial emphasis of the sealing ceremony was on enacting plural sealings---sealings for civilly  married couples appears to have been of much less concern.
