Virtually all early sealings were polygamous sealings (_in stead of_ a sealing to an existing civil wife).  The one exception, the sealing of Newel and Elizabeth Whitney, was associated with a polygamous sealing (Joseph to their daughter, Sarah Ann).[^loyalty_reward]

Data assembled from Table 1 and Table 2 of Gary Bergera's article [The Earliest Eternal Sealings for Civilly Married Couples Living and Dead](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V35N03_49.pdf)

[^heber_c_kimball]: A straightforward reading of [Helen Mar Kimball's account](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1737&context=byusq) indicates that Heber had already been sealed to Sarah Perry Peak Noon when he told his first wife, Vilate, about the principle of celestial marriage ("She was also shown the woman he had taken to wife").  Bergera states "when this sealing [between Heber and Vilate] occurred, it either preceded or coincided with Kimball's own first plural marriage in early 1842."

[^loyalty_reward]: According to Lyndon Cook (as paraphrased by Bergera) "the prophet rewarded the Whitneys' loyalty [demonstrated by giving their daughter to be sealed to JS] by sealing them for eternity."

[^preemptive_sealing]: Joseph Smith preemptively sealed himself to Orson Hyde's civil wife.

The data clearly show that the initial emphasis of the sealing ceremony was on enacting plural sealings---sealings for civilly  married couples appears to have been of much less concern.  This emphasis also seems to be confirmed in other instances, such as JS's sealing to Lucy Walker but [lack of a sealing for William Holmes Walker](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/c442ec967fc02943365dd08a6f64b0d5bbb92060/documents/polygamy/william-holmes-walker.md).
