[very rough draft]

## Introduction

Explain the narrative.

## Main arguments for why Joseph did *not* practice polygamy

The following are the primary arguments people use to posit that Joseph did not practice polygamy:

### Joseph left no progeny.
    
* There are [good reasons]({{ "/why-joseph-not-sire-children-plural-wives/" | relative_url }}) that might explain why Joseph did not sire progeny in these relationships.
* There are potential progeny that have not yet been tested (see [same document]({{ "/why-joseph-not-sire-children-plural-wives/" | relative_url }}))

### Joseph's denials

Joseph may have lied or misled about many other events:

* Book of Commandment retrofit
* Account of visiting Charles Anthon
* JST copies Clarke in hundreds of cases with no attribution

### Other testimony denying he practiced polygamy

Emma, etc.

### Conflicting evidence

Conflicting and impossible testimony.

## Arguments for why Joseph *did* practice polygamy

### The Sarah Ann Whitney documents

We have primary documentation—all in Joseph Smith’s handwriting—suggesting intense interest in the 17-18 year old Sarah Ann Whitney expressed in a variety of ways:

* a blessing that seems consistent with a polygamous relationship
* a letter to the Whitneys that is consistent with a liason outside the auspices of Emma
* A deed of property to Sarah Ann

These documents all align with the claims of the Whitneys that Joseph was involved in a polygamous relationship with Sarah Ann. If there are alternative theories that make sense of all three of these documents outside of a polygamous relationship, I am not aware of them. In addition, there exists other contemporary documentation pointing to Joseph Smith’s polygamy (see [here]({{ "/contemporary-evidence-that-joseph-smith-practiced-polygamy/" | relative_url }}) for all the documentation including the 3 Sarah Ann docs)

### Oliver's letter

### Other contemporary evidence

### Testimony with opposing bias

Both antagonists (e.g., [Martha Brotherton]({{ "/martha-brotherton-affidavit/" | relative_url }})) and most supporters of Smith claimed (at least eventually) that he practiced polygamy. When those with opposing bias all point to the same observation, it strengthens the claim (consider the [principles of source criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_criticism#Principles)).
