## Introduction

A hermetic seal is one which is entirely airtight. A hermetically sealed system of thought is, by analogy, one which is cutoff from, or virtually impervious to, outside ways of thinking.

Generally, a hermetically sealed system of thought may be created when a person accepts one or more assumptions (sometimes unawares) which then prevent them from ever arriving at conclusions outside the resulting system of thought.  From *within* the system it appears that the full range of choices and possibilities are available, but the thought structure makes some conclusions virtually inaccessible to reach.

Hermetically sealed systems of thought may be viewed as a subset of the greater [socializing influence the LDS Church and its culture exhibits]({{ "/lds-indoctrination-and-retentive-socialization/" | relative_url }}) which discourages members from exploring alternatives.

## Examples from other groups

It is usually easier to spot hermetically sealed systems of thought in groups of which a person is not a member.  Here are two simple examples from the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization.

### Example 1: avoid criticism

Avoiding criticism 

Assumed: To love God means to entirely avoid communication with a former Jehovah’s Witness.
Innaccessible: Exposure to criticism from former Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Example:

…should we listen to apostates, read their literature, or examine their Web sites on the Internet? If we love God and the truth, we will not do so. We should not allow apostates into our homes or even greet them, for such actions would make us ‘sharers in their wicked works.’ (2 John 9-11) (source)


Assumed: You will miss the good and only see bad if you focus on the flaws of the organization or leaders.

Innaccessible: Aspects of the organization or the actions or teachings of some leaders may be ethically deficient but may be un-observable if one only focuses on the good.

Example:

Every person in this organization–every one of Jehovah’s Witnesses including the governing body–we’re all imperfect and thus we are subject to making mistakes. Which means that if you look hard enough, all you will see instead of seeing these amazing things that Jehovah is accomplishing and our tremendous privilege of being part of it, all we are going to see is the errors of men. But when we focus on the good, on the guidance and loving support that we’ve received, aren’t we moved with appreciation to cleave to this body of fellow worshipers. And just look at what Jehovah is accomplishing by means of his imperfect servants. There is no other organization on earth providing spiritual food like the one that we belong to. When we look at all of this, how could we possibly let the failings of just a few people undermine this overwhelming proof of Jehova’s backing? (From the 2016 “Remain Loyal To Jehovah” regional convention)
Structure and Veracity
These diagrams say nothing (directly) about how well these systems of thought coincide with reality.  However, examining the systems of thought in this form may make it easier for the reader to determine if the systems are veridical (i.e., coincide with reality).
Structure and Agency
Regardless of whether these systems of thought are veridical, their structure may demonstrate aspects of LDS thought which do not allow members and investigators the full latitude of thought to consider alternative conclusions.  Given the preeminence of agency in LDS thought, members and leaders may wish to reconsider how some teachings are presented or structured.
