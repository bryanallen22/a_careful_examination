Came across this quote in a book by Shulem Deen about leaving Hasidic Judaism. I thought you guys might like it.

> Even asking questions was forbidden. “Isn’t Judaism all about asking questions?” People would later ask. “Isn’t the Talmud filled with questions?” The Judaism of our ancient text allows for questions, true, but they must be of a certain kind, and they must be asked just so…If one is plagued by question for which there are no answers, it is not the fault of our faith, but the fault of the questioner who has surely not prayed enough, studied enough, cleansed his heart and mind enough so that the wisdom of the Torah might penetrate his soul and make all questions fall away.
