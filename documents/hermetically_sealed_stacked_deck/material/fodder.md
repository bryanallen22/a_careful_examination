A [hermetic seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_seal) is one which is entirely airtight.  A hermetically sealed system of thought is, by analogy, one which is cutoff from, or virtually impervious to, outside ways of thinking.

In a religious context, a hermetically sealed system of thought is created when a person accepts one or more assumptions (sometimes accepted unawares) which then prevent them from ever arriving at a conclusion *outside* the prescribed system of thought.

Hermetically sealed systems typically grow out of [totalistic groups](https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/three-fold-nature-lds-church-corporate-totalistic-individual-growth/) that use [thought-reform techniques](http://www.exitsupportnetwork.com/artcls/mindctrl/lifton.htm), particularly "milieu control", "mystical manipulation", "sacred science", "loading the language", "doctrine over person", and "dispensing of existence" to exert influence over their membership.

when we focus on faults of others it breeds a critical spirit which leads to
disloyalty

when we focus on good in others and Jehovah's organization 

Every person in this organization--everyone one of JWs including the governing body--we're all imperfect and thus we are subject to making mistakes.  Which means that if you look hard enough, all you will see instead of seeing these amazing things that Jehovah is accomplishing and our tremendous priviledge of being part of it, all we are going to see is the errors of men.  But when we focus on the good, on the guidance and loving support that we've received, aren't we moved with appreciation to cleave to this body of fellow worshippers.  And just look at what Jehovah is accomplishing by means of his imperfect servants.  There is no other organization on earth providing spiritual food like the one that we belong to.  When we look at all of this, how could we possibly let the failings of just a few people undermine this overwhelming proof of Jehova's backing?






So to sum it up, when we focus on the faults of others it breeds a critical spirit which can ultimately lead to disloyalty.  But when we focus on good in others and in Jehovah's organization it breeds appreciation for all that's been done which leads to loyalty to our God and to the body of worshippers that he is using today.

36:30

These people hate us, 

You can't trust them.

You are either a Jacob or an Esau.  If you are Jacob you want nothing to do with the world.

Did you form close friendships with people who were outside your Church and if so, what was that like?

Not very close because we were always really suspicious of people outside the Church... Of course, this was something that was drummed into us all our lives.  "These people hate each other" we would say.  And they certainly hate us.  They don't care about you.  They don't care about each other.  All they want to do is live how they wnat to live and encourage one another in their sins and you can't trust them.

"The stronger your group identity the greater your ability to suppress empathy
for the outgroup."


"God is the only person authorized to criticize his messengers."

When we focus on the faults of others

We never engage in debate

We do not engage in any kind of debate.  We don't engage in debate.

The media is Satan's media, hence you should not believe any attacks on our Church that comes through the media.



Satan believes we are only loyal for what we get out of it.  Hence, being
loyal to the JWs, even if it is contrary to our health of happiness is a way to disprove Satan.

Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and lean unto him and


...should we listen to apostates, read their literature, or examine their Web sites on the Internet? If we love God and the truth, we will not do so. We should not allow apostates into our homes or even greet them, for such actions would make us ‘sharers in their wicked works.’ (2 John 9-11)
