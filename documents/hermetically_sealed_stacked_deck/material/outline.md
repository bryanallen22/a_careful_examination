Playing with a hermetically sealed stacked deck


1. The growth (or lack thereof) is always according to prophecy and gods plan.

Is the Church experiencing rapid growth?

Church will fill the whole earth (when growing)
Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is  the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
Even the very elect will be deceived.

        "I stand here to plead with you, my brethren and sisters, not to
        permit words of criticism or of unkindness to pass your lips about
        those whom the Lord has called to lead us. Do not be found in the
        companionship of those who would belittle them or weaken their
        influence among the children of men. If you do, I can say to you that
        you will find yourselves in the power of the adversary."

Faith is a reward of personal righteousness

    [No] Good.  Continue having faith.
    [cannot access] The evidence ought to generate doubt in the doctrine.

The purpose of life is to be tested to see if you will do what God wants.
    Are you acting contrary to the Church, the Kingdom of God on Earth?
    [Yes] You had one goal, and you failed it.
    [No] You're passing the most important test.
    [cannot access] You should figure out what you think is right and always do that.

## Don't pray against what is already accepted by the Church

New seminary statement

## If you get a feeling that goes against the Church it is not of God

1912 FP statement

When … inspiration conveys something out of harmony with the accepted revelations of the Church or contrary to the decisions of its constituted authorities, Latter-day Saints may know that it is not of God, no matter how plausible it may appear.

## Keep praying

Didn't get a confirmation?  Keep praying!  If you didn't get an answer, then
it is because

* "we must have a sincere *desire* to believe" ("sustained effort")

> To my young friend, and to all wherever you may be, never give up on the Lord. The answer to your prayers may not be as clear or as timely as you would like, but keep praying

    “Have you prayed to find out if what we are teaching you is true?”

    I told them I had but had not obtained any answer.

    “You must pray with real intent,” they said.

    ...

    I told Him I needed to know if He had really manifested Himself to Joseph Smith. If He had, I promised Him I would be baptized into the Church and serve Him all my life.

## Criticism

Mocking or deny: The Sealed Portion: 1:15  And many shall mock at these things and contend against the word of the Lord. Behold, thus saith the Lord unto those who shall mock and deny these things: Let them be accursed from hence forth and forever. For they have sealed unto themselves eternal damnation, insomuch that I will show no greater things unto them.

## Leaders are always right

The system is always perfect (mistakes are from men)

Changes are always signficant (but do not indicate any *need* for change)


the Lord will never allow the [Mormon] prophet to lead his church astray

## Apostates

lazy or prideful

Among the Latter-day Saints, the preaching of false doctrines disguised as truths of the gospel, may be expected from people of two classes, and practically from these only; they are:
First—The hopelessly ignorant, whose lack of intelligence is due to their indolence and sloth, who make but feeble effort, if indeed any at all, to better themselves by reading and study; those who are afflicted with a dread disease that may develop into an incurable malady—laziness.
Second—The proud and self-vaunting ones, who read by the lamp of their own conceit; who interpret by rules of their own contriving; who have become a law unto themselves, and so pose as the sole judges of their own doings. More dangerously ignorant than the first.
Beware of the lazy and the proud."
(Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph F. Smith, Chapter 13: Stand by the Truth Lest You Be Deceived)
