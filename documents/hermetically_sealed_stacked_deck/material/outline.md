Playing with a hermetically sealed stacked deck


1. The growth (or lack thereof) is always according to prophecy and gods plan.

Is the Church experiencing rapid growth?

Church will fill the whole earth (when growing)
Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is  the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
Even the very elect will be deceived.

        "I stand here to plead with you, my brethren and sisters, not to
        permit words of criticism or of unkindness to pass your lips about
        those whom the Lord has called to lead us. Do not be found in the
        companionship of those who would belittle them or weaken their
        influence among the children of men. If you do, I can say to you that
        you will find yourselves in the power of the adversary."

Does it look like the prophet did something wrong?
[Yes] - The prophet cannot lead you astray.  He may have made a mistake, that is all.
[No] - Nothing to worry about.
[cannot access] The prophet led the Church astray.

-- Jesus wicked sign seeking
Are you seeking additional evidence of a truth-claim?
[Yes] That's seeking a sign.  You are wicked and adulterous.
[No] Good.  Having faith is critical to your progression.

-- Associating with those who criticize the Brethren is to put yourselves in the power of the adversary.
You are speaking with someone who is talking about Church leaders.
    Are they criticizing a Church leader?
    [Yes] They are in the power of the adversary, and you will be too if you continue to talk with them.
    [No] Carry on.  This will build your testimony.
    [cannot access] The actions of a Church leader should be criticized.

Faith is a reward of personal righteousness
    Do you doubt some Church doctrine?
    [Yes] You have not been righteous enough.
    [No] Good.  Continue having faith.
    [cannot access] The evidence ought to generate doubt in the doctrine.

The purpose of life is to be tested to see if you will do what God wants.
    Are you acting contrary to the Church, the Kingdom of God on Earth?
    [Yes] You had one goal, and you failed it.
    [No] You're passing the most important test.
    [cannot access] You should figure out what you think is right and always do that.

## Criticism

Mocking or deny: The Sealed Portion: 1:15  And many shall mock at these things and contend against the word of the Lord. Behold, thus saith the Lord unto those who shall mock and deny these things: Let them be accursed from hence forth and forever. For they have sealed unto themselves eternal damnation, insomuch that I will show no greater things unto them.

## Leaders are always right

The system is always perfect (mistakes are from men)

Changes are always signficant (but do not indicate any *need* for change)


the Lord will never allow the [Mormon] prophet to lead his church astray

The Church is behind on social issues because the prophet can only teach what
the membership is willing to bear (i.e., the members aren't righteous enough).

"The church itself contradicts this line of thinking because they claim the prophet will always teach what is right, not what is popular."


# Association

Temple recommend question: Do you support, affiliate with, or agree with any group or individual whose teachings or practices are contrary to or oppose those accepted by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?
