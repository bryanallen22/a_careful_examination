## LDS Perspective

Especially since the [1995 Proclamation on the Family](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng), Latter-day Saints have tended to *emphasize* the gender binary.  The second paragraph reads:

> All human beings—male and female—are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.

Nonetheless, there is still some significant room within broader LDS theology to contemplate non gender binaries or transgender individual realities.[^progressive]

* Joseph Fielding Smith postulated that those in the telestial kingdom would be "neither man nor woman" ([Doctrines of Salvation v2, p 287](https://archive.org/details/Doctrines-of-Salvation-volume-2-joseph-fielding-smith/page/n177/mode/2up)). This was probably suggested as an undesirable outcome, but regardless it means that eternal gender was contemplated alternate to a strict gender binary.

[^progressive]: Admittedly, most of those exploring this territory are progressive and/or queer members, but there still may be some validity to their perspective, even to more orthodox members.

[^family_proclamation]: Additional statements may have been made since then.

[^bio461]: The authors engage in a significant amount of speculation and inference, and I personally disagree with many of their conclusions, but their engagement with the topic is more biologically informed and theologically broad than is typical of many LDS circles.
