* [wikipedia: Sex and gender distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_distinction)

    "... it follows from the principles of Ca2+- physiology and homeostasis that all individuals of a sexually reproducing animal population have a personalized gender behaviour"

## Multi-cultural

## LDS Perspective

Especially since the [1995 Proclamation on the Family](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng), Latter-day Saints have tended to *emphasize* the gender binary.  The second paragraph reads:

> All human beings—male and female—are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.

Nonetheless, there is still some significant room within broader LDS theology to contemplate non gender binaries or transgender individual realities.[^progressive]

* [The Proclamation on the Family: Scripture or Revelation?](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/proclamation-on-the-family-scripture-or-revelation/)[^family_proclamation] (argues that the Family Proclamation was not referred to as "scripture" or "revelation" in years after the proclamation was given).
* Joseph Fielding Smith postulated that those in the telestial kingdom would be "neither man nor woman" ([Doctrines of Salvation v2, p 287](https://archive.org/details/Doctrines-of-Salvation-volume-2-joseph-fielding-smith/page/n177/mode/2up)). This was probably suggested as an undesirable outcome, but regardless it means that eternal gender was contemplated alternate to a strict gender binary.

[^progressive]: Admittedly, most of those exploring this territory are progressive and/or queer members, but there still may be some validity to their perspective, even to more orthodox members.

[^family_proclamation]: Additional statements may have been made since then.
