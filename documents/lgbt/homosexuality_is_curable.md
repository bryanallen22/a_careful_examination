## Introduction

Between the 1970s and to about 2010, official LDS publications have declared in absolute terms that homosexuality "is curable", is not "preset", and that no one is born "that way".

At least as early as 1995 this message began to change.  Elder Dallin Oaks, in [a 1995 Ensign article](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/10/same-gender-attraction?lang=eng&_r=1), stated:

>  Perhaps such susceptibilities are inborn or acquired without personal choice or fault ...

And the website [Mormon and Gay](https://mormonandgay.lds.org/articles/frequently-asked-questions?lang=eng) now teaches:

> ... Many people pray for years and do all they can to be obedient in an effort to reduce same-sex attraction, yet find they are still attracted to the same sex. ...

## Official Publications

The following statements were all published by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  I am not aware that any apology or redaction exists for any of these statements. Statements are listed in chronological order.

### They can overcome and return to normal ... living

> homosexuals can be assured that in spite of all they may have heard from other sources, they can overcome and return to normal, happy living.

First Presidency Circular Letter, March 19, 1970, LDS Church Archives.

### born "that way" ... a base lie

> Satan tells his victims that it is a natural way of life; that it is normal; that perverts are a different kind of people born ‘that way’ and that they cannot change.  This is a base lie.  All normal people have sex urges and if they control such urges, they grow strong and masterful.  If they yield to their carnal desires and urges, they get weaker until their sins get beyond control.  ‘The knowledge that homosexuality can be effectively treated must be made more generally known, to offset the effect of organized groups of homosexuals who would have society accept homosexuality and relieve them of the pressure to undergo the changes that can be effected through appropriate treatment… It can be overcome and the case of difficulty of overcoming depends largely upon the strength or weakness of the individual, the depth of his entrenchment, the quality and quantity of his desire and determination.’

> Some continue until, when the changing gets difficult, they admit their inability to cope with it and yield.  They rationalize that they are of another class of people; that the Lord made them that way; that they cannot change.  The powerful Lucifer has had his day.

> God made no man a pervert.  To blame a weakness and transgression upon God is cowardly.

> God did not make men evil.  He did not make people ‘that way.’

[New Horizons for Homosexuals](http://www.mormonthink.com/files/New-Horizons-for-Homosexuals-by-Apostle-Spencer-W-Kimball.pdf), published by the church in 1971

### Homosexuality is curable

> After consideration of the evil aspects, the ugliness and prevalence of the evil of homosexuality, the glorious thing to remember is that it [homosexuality] is curable and forgiveable.  ... Certainly it can be overcome, for there are numerous happy people who were once involved in its clutches and who have since completely transformed their lives.  Therefore to those who say that this practice or any other evil is incurable, I respond: "How can you say the door cannot be opened until your knuckles are bloody, till your head is bruised, till your muscles are sore?"

> Many have been misinformed that they are powerless in the matter, not responsible for the tendency, and that ‘God made them that way.’ This is as untrue as any other of the diabolical lies Satan has concocted. It is blasphemy. Man is made in the image of God. Does the pervert think God to be ‘that way’?” 

LDS Institute Manual [The Life And Teachings Of Jesus And His Apostles](https://archive.org/details/TheLifeAndTeachingsOfJesusAndHisApostlesLDSManual/page/n321)  pg 317 (quoting Spencer W. Kimball's The Miracle of Forgiveness) (The manual was copyrighted in [1978 and 1979](https://archive.org/details/TheLifeAndTeachingsOfJesusAndHisApostlesLDSManual/page/n1) and was superceded by [a new manual in 2014](https://www.lds.org/manual/new-testament-student-manual/title-page?lang=eng), I believe)

### Some suppose that they were preset

> Some suppose that they were preset and cannot overcome what they feel are inborn temptations toward the impure and unnatural. Not so! [Why would our Heavenly Father do that to anyone?] Remember, God is our Heavenly Father.  (bracketed text in audio/video only)
