See [Mennonite Church Canada General Board Confession, September 28, 2017](https://imgur.com/a/g7xoV#I0NJD9y)

...We sincerely regret and apologize for the actions and decisions within our Body that caused such testimony [testimony of LGBTQ individuals being ignored, physically abused, or silenced].  We confess that at times the Body of Christ did not act like his Body.

... the General Board of Mennonite Church Canada apologizes to our LGBTQ members as well as their family and friends for these mistakes....
