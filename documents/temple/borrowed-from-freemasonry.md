Joseph Smith became a Freemason on [March 15, 1842](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-4-chapter-32). Seven weeks later, the endowment ceremony was introduced [May 4--5, 1842](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V34N0102_87.pdf). The ceremonies are strikingly similar in many regards. [Church leaders have claimed](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1737&context=byusq) that freemasonry is a corrupted version of the endowment ceremony which was handed down from Solomon's temple. However, current evidence indicates that [Freemasonry originated in medieval Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Freemasonry#From_origin_to_Grand_Lodge_Freemasonry).
