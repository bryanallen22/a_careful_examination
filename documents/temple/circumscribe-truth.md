## Influences before the LDS temple ceremony

### "Circumscribe our desires ... within due bounds"

The phrase "circumscribe our desires and to keep our passions in [or sometimes "within"] due bounds with all mankind, especially the brethren" is common [across the masonic literature](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=circumscribe+our+desires+and+to+keep+our+passions+in+due+bounds+with+all+mankind%2C+especially+the+brethren&ia=web) and is part of how freemasons [describe their use of the square and compass](https://www.masonic-lodge-of-education.com/square-and-compasses.html) as part of their symbolism.

### "Circumscribe the law of nature"

A 1793 book on the Law of Scotland, by Thomas Erskine, [a Grand Master Mason of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Erskine,_Lord_Erskine), [stated](https://books.google.com/books?id=5IE18rpqPF4C&pg=PA7&dq=%22circumscribe%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjhncCS7IrkAhXRHjQIHVHLCCIQ6AEwCHoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=%22circumscribe%22&f=false):

> The supreme power may not only superadd, but even circumscribe or set bounds to the law of nature, without violating its authority.

And in the paragraph summary:

> The supreme power may add to, or circumscribe the law of nature

### "Divine truth gathered from ... the wide field of revelation"

https://books.google.com/books?id=doAUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA639&dq=%22truth+gathered%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjK3s_16orkAhXfCTQIHUpqDVMQ6AEwA3oECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=%22truth%20gathered%22&f=false

### Mathematical proofs with the compass

One of the key tools in geometry was the compass, and constructing geometric shapes and relationships using it (and a straightedge) was [a big deal preceding the LDS temple ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction), in general.

In 1796, "Carl Friedrich Gauss proves that the regular 17-gon can be constructed using only a compass and straightedge" ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_geometry#18th_century))

It is unreasonable to conclude that his finding influenced JS in creating the phrase

## Similar found *after* the LDS temple ceremony

It's possible that later statements were influenced by the LDS temple phrase, but they may also indicate independent thought along similar lines in other masonic groups.

Joseph E. Morcombe, an editor of Masonic [historical?] material, wrote of listening to three Past Grand Masters of Iowa (sometime in the early 1900s?).  [One of them stated](https://archive.org/details/GouldRFALibraryOfFreemasonryVol51911_201705/page/n829):

> "Masonry, as I understand it, lays claim to **embrace all truth**.  It is not limited to what is specified in its ritual or even that which is remotely hinted at in its extensive sybolism.  As it has borrowed and preserved truths from all the religions and philosophies of the past, and has shared in many social and political changes, all these must be closely studied to understand the course of development.  And as Masonry also professes a broad receptivity, and its best thought is ever in the formative stage, therefore **all the arts and sciences are within its scope**.  He is the best informed as a Mason who is **most thoroughly versed in the ever-widening knowledge of the time**." (emphasis added)
