### Introduction

In May of 2018, as LDS leaders were about to meet with NAACP leaders, a fake Mormon Newsroom release was made that closely mimicked the look and feel of the actual Mormon Newsroom.  The release included a (fake) letter from the First Presidency formally apologizing for its racist teachings and the Priesthood/temple ban.
