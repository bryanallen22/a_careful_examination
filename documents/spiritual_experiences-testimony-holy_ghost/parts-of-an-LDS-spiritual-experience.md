## Introduction

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that the Holy Ghost is central to understanding truth.[^understanding_truth]. Knowledge gained by the Holy Ghost is considered the foundation of a testimony, which is, [according to Elder Dallin H. Oaks](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/04/testimony?lang=eng), a “personal witness borne to our souls by the Holy Ghost that certain facts of eternal significance are true and that we know them to be true.”

### LDS description

The Preach My Gospel manual, [chapter 4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/how-do-i-recognize-and-understand-the-spirit?lang=eng), gives a clear and understanable summary of the kinds of phenomena meant to indicate an experience with the Holy Ghost, (aka The Spirit).  Those most directly related to mental and physical phenomena---are reproduced below:[^complete_list]

* "Gives feelings of love, joy, peace, patience, meekness, gentleness, faith, and hope."
* "Gives ideas in the mind, feelings in the heart."
* "Occupies the mind and presses on the feelings."
* "Helps scriptures have strong effect."
* "Gives good feelings to teach if something is true."
* "Enlightens the mind."
* "Replaces darkness with light."
* "Strengthens the desire to avoid evil and obey the commandments."
* "Teaches truth and brings it to remembrance."
* "Gives feelings of peace and comfort."
* "Guides to truth and shows things to come."
* "Reveals truth."
* "Guides and protects from deception."
* "Helps to perceive or discern the thoughts of others."
* "Tells what to pray for."
* "Tells what to do."
* "Edifies both teacher and students."

### Potential phenomenological explanations

What is perceived as an LDS spiritual experience (or the Spirit or Holy Ghost) may involve one or more of these elements:[^different_perspectives]

1. A feeling of [elevation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation_%28emotion%29): this is a hormonally-mediated feeling that produces a "swelling" feeling in the chest and is generated when witnessing or performing altruistic acts or participating in acts of transcendent beauty.[^oxytocin]
1. [Frisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisson): "a psychophysiological response to rewarding auditory and/or visual stimuli that often induces a pleasurable or otherwise positively-valenced affective state."
2. The warm glow of familiarity (aka “glow of warmth”): We resonate with things we are already familiar with. There is also a tendency to believe information to be correct after repeated exposure known as the [illusory truth effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_truth_effect) (e.g., [retentive socialization and indoctrination]({{ "/lds-indoctrination-and-retentive-socialization/" | relative_url }}) within the LDS Church).  This may be why a Latter-day Saint doesn’t feel exactly the same “Spirit” when they attend a Catholic service and why the Catholic also doesn’t feel exactly the same “spirit” attending an LDS service.
3. Some kind of [inner speech](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/internal-speech-is-driven-by-predictive-brain-signal.html) or [inner experience](https://faculty.unlv.edu/hurlburt/sampling.html): this is the mind part of "I will tell you in your _mind_ and in your heart" (D&C 8:2).
4. Congruence with accepted LDS doctrine or current policy.  Although the relationship is probably complex, it's reasonable to postulate that oxytocin release is related to [tend and befriend](https://www.apa.org/monitor/feb08/oxytocin.aspx) tendencies.  Hence, rumination on ideas which are accepted by one's group are more likely to initiate strong oxytocin type responses.  Formally speaking, any inspiration which is received that does not affirm LDS doctrine and current policy is not considered _The Spirit_ by Latter-day Saints.  This was canonized in a 1913 First Presidency Statement:

    > When … inspiration conveys something out of harmony with the accepted revelations of the Church or contrary to the decisions of its constituted authorities, Latter-day Saints may know that it is not of God, no matter how plausible it may appear. (Gospel Doc­trine Teacher’s Man­u­al [Les­son 6: “I Will Tell You in Your Mind and in Your Heart, by the Holy Ghost”](https://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-and-church-history-gospel-doctrine-teachers-manual/lesson-6-i-will-tell-you-in-your-mind-and-in-your-heart-by-the-holy-ghost?lang=eng))

## Ways that experiences may be dismissed

Some of the phenomena used above seem to be used occasionally by Latter-day Saints to *dismiss* a purported spiritual experiences of former members, questioners, or those of other faith traditions.

* "You may have felt good while watching that movie, but that's just a good feeling because the Spirit must also convey intelligence to your mind" (fails to manifest element #3 - must convey something to the mind)
* "Of course Catholics feel a portion of the spirit, but every time I attend a Catholic service I don't feel _the same_ spirit there, so I don't believe they have all the truth" (fails to manifest element #2 - familiarity)
* "You say that "the Spirit" told you the brethren are in error (or you should be re-baptized, or Joseph Smith was wrong about polygamy, or you should leave the Church, etc) but that cannot be the Spirit since the Spirit will never contradict accepted LDS doctrine or currently accepted policy" (fails to manifest element #4).

While virtually any positive feeling can be considered the Spirit if it is in support of LDS truth-claims, and LDS missionaries are quick to identify those feelings in investigators as the Spirit, skepticism and heightened scrutiny seem reserved for those experiences which contradict LDS truth-claims.

[^oxytocin]: A direct connection between variants in oxytocin receptor genes (OXTR rs53576, rs6449182 and rs3796863) and receptivity to spiritual feelings has been demonstrated by [Cappellen et al in 2016](https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/10/1579/2413952) ([summary](https://today.duke.edu/2016/09/oxytocin-enhances-spirituality-new-study-says)).

[^different_perspectives]: Certain psychophysiological experiences may correlate with a spiritual experience, as described above. A naturalist might suggest that the entirety of the experience might be explained via such mechanisms.  On the other hand, many believing Latter-day Saint might argue that these experiences are initiated or driven by encounters with The Holy Ghost and largely mediated by spirit to spirit communication apart from human physiology.  Other Latter-day Saints would argue that psychophysiological phenomena either correlate with, or are part of God-given mechanisms used to convey or enhance spiritual experiences.

[^understanding_truth]: The LDS Church teaches that the Holy Ghost is central to understanding truth:
    * And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things. ([Moroni 10:5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.5))
    * But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. ([John 14:26](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.26))
    * [The Holy Ghost] will show unto you all things what ye should do. ([2Ne 32:5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.5))

    And leaders have taught:

    > When we know spiritual truths by spiritual means, we can be just as sure of that knowledge as scholars and scientists are of the different kinds of knowledge they have acquired by different methods. ([Oaks, April 2008 Conference](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/04/testimony?lang=eng#watch=video))
