The article "The Game of Life" features a heart-wrenching story about Jimmy Daniels being kicked off the team and the team losing a playoff game as a result.

According to Lynn Packer's [Paul H. Dunn Fields of Dreams](https://web.archive.org/web/20161222205336/https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/083-35-57.pdf) (Sunstone, Sep 1991)

> There is no Jimmy Daniels listed on the baseball roster [at Dunn's HS]. Perhaps Dunn was using a pseudonym for Daniels without disclosing it. That hardly matters, because no one on the team was in a playoff game: Hollywood High finished next to last in 1941 and third in 1942.
