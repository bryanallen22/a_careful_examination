> Re: LOL. That's the story Dunn told his wife, Morgan Fairchild. :-)

> Back in the 1960s (yes, I'm that old) my college had "Religion in Life Week" where representatives of various religious traditions would come to campus and participate in various events for a week. The Mormon representative was Paul H. Dunn.

> I attended the kick-off dinner where all the various representatives spoke. Dunn was the best speaker. That week he spoke to my R.O.T.C. (Rotten Old Tin Cans) class. He sat on the edge of the instructor's desk and told us the story of the guy dying in his arms talking about how it was a privilege to die for his country. I was seated about 10 feet away. After he left, our R.O.T.C. instructor told the class we were lucky to have gotten the best speaker.

> He was the only Sacrament-meeting speaker, and basically gave a Mormon comedy routine for the full hour. I've never experienced anything like it before or since in Sacrament meeting.

> He was electrifying, and we ALL felt the spirit testify to us that what he was saying was true.

> When people talk about the spirit testifying to them of the "truth" of things, I bring up Paul H. Dunn.

> The next year my R.O.T.C. class again got the Mormon representative. This time it was A. Theodore Tuttle, and he droned on about how similarity between Polynesian and American Indian blood-types somehow supported the Book of Mormon (ah the good, old pre-DNA years when Mormons when Mormons were the ones who brought up that kind of topic). I'm SURE that no GA would want to open up that can of worms today.

> I was still a teenager ca 1971 and some Mormon "friends" took me to a meeting in Riverside,CA which had a fantastic speaker.

> You have to understand the impact - the chapel and cultural hall were filled to overflowing and enthusiastic,successful people were lining the hallways.  That's how it was in those days.

> The speaker was riveting and dynamic, everyone remarked what a spiritual giant he was.

> He was Paul Dunn.

> I had been toying with the idea of becoming a Mormon and this man, the meeting, and the people sealed my fate. I joined.

> FUCK Paul Dunn.

> It took another 30 years, the web and DNA to break lose from Mormonism.
