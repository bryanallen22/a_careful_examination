Analyzing how spiritual experiences work is not too suggest that they do not
come from God.  However, because they are mediated by biological/neurological phenomena, we owe them due skepticism!

[Please note, I still firmly believe that we should live with an attitude of gratitude]

The BITE model and "mind control" and hidden bias

    Assemble two teams. One team will consist of engineers, the other will consist of very spiritual individuals from the Church (they cannot be engineers). These teams will set out to build a rocket ship that will carry one individual into space and safely return them to Earth. The engineers get to use scientific methods. The Church members will get to use "The Spirit" (since it reveals the truth in all things). We will then place the President of Science in the engineers ship and the President of the Church in the members vessel. We shoot them off and see what happens.
