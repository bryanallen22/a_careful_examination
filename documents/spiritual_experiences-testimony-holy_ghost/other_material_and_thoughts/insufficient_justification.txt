"Another way to seek a testimony seems astonishing when compared with the methods of obtaining other knowledge. We gain or strengthen a testimony by bearing it." Dallan H. Oaks

"A testimony is to be found in the bearing of it! ... Can you not see that it will be supplied as you share it?"Â Boyd K. Packer

"More people have obtained a testimony while standing up trying to bear it than down on their knees praying for it." Brigham Young
