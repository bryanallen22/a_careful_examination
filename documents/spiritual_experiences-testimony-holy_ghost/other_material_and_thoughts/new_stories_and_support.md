TL;dr: I did the whole name and a blessing thing as a non-believer in the LDS church. I purposefully rejected God from the whole thing. Secular blessing. Afterwards, a few random people, some I respected, tried to tell me how the Spirit was so strong, they could tell at one point the Spirit took over, etc. I suddenly realized how easy it is to dupe people who want to believe. Blew my mind.

Now that my hair is long and my beard is full, the Holy Ghost is inspiring people to reach out to me. They have no idea why, just that they need to reach out to tell me Jesus loves me.
When my hair was short and I was clean shaven (but I was just as apostate as I am now), guess how many people Jesus inspired to reach out to me to convey his love???
If you guessed zero, then you guessed correctly.

So, the new manuals for seminary and institute are out. Certain less popular topics (seer stone, polygamy in a little detail), are included. I was reading the polygamy section and was a little horrified at the hypocrisy. The full lesson can be found here: https://www.lds.org/manual/foundations-of-the-restoration-teacher-manual/lesson-20-plural-marriage?lang=eng
Quoting from an early part of the lesson: "You may want to remind students that as they study about plural marriage, they should remember the pattern that the Prophet Joseph Smith followed in his gospel learning. He studied, pondered, and prayed to gain knowledge."
Then at the end of the lesson: "Before concluding the lesson, it may be wise to tell students that some people who have apostatized from the Church are practicing plural marriage today. They urge people to pray and ponder about whether it is right to practice plural marriage today. We should not seek to receive revelation that is contrary to what the Lord has revealed through His prophets."
so... it is great to pray about things. You should and must pray about things to understand them and gain a testimony. BUT, you're only allowed to pray about things that we tell you are true.
Am I the only one that found this a little disingenuous?

They urge people to pray and ponder about whether it is right to practice plural marriage today. We should not seek to receive revelation that is contrary to what the Lord has revealed through His prophets. The Lord has revealed through His prophet that the practice of plural marriage has ceased in the Church. Anyone who advocates the practice of plural marriage today is not a servant of the Lord.

One of my favorite stories from Boyd K. Packer was always his analogy comparing spiritual knowledge to the taste of salt. I felt it captured humans' innate sixth sense, if you will: our basic ability to sense spiritual things, a fundamental input to our mortal frame like sight, sound, and taste.
To summarize the interaction, an athiest asks Elder Packer how he KNOWS God exists. Packer asks him if he knows what salt tastes like and asks him to describe what it tastes like. Packer finally quips,
My friend, spiritually speaking, I have tasted salt. I am no more able to convey to you in words how this knowledge has come than you are to tell me what salt tastes like.
This analogy made so much sense to me. The ineffable experience of salt was so much like the ineffable experience of the Divine. As an active TBM, when I read Jonathan Haidt's "Happiness Hypothesis," I saw the idea's biological/psychological basis; when I read Yuval Harari's "Sapiens," I saw the idea's sociological basis.
And then my Shelf broke.
I still think about the analogy occasionally (that's not really saying too much because random crap pops into my head all the time), and I was thinking the other day, I wish the atheist had been a little more on his toes (assuming the interaction actually took place), and said something like:
"Yes, you know it tastes like salt, but how do you KNOW it is salt? How do you know it's sodium chloride? Aren't there salt substitutes? How do you know, based on taste alone, that what you have is truly salt?
"The question you've answered is 'How does salt taste?' not 'How do you know it is salt?'
"I'm not asking what it feels like to receive a Divine communication. I'm asking how you know it is Divine? Just because you FEEL it is Divine, does that make it true? Are feelings the same as knowledge?"
So now when I think about the story, it kind of tastes like dogmatic dog shit.
