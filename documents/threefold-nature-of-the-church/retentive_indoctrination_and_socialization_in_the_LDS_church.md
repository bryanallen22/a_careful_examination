## Introduction

In [A Message To The Most Ardent Critic Of The Mormon Church](http://www.mormonlight.org/2017/08/14/message-ardent-critic-church/), Ben Arkell quotes a nameless member of the church who had recently dropped off their daughter and son at the Missionary Training Center (MTC) (emphasis added):

> “I wish I could go to those who have walked away from the Church, and those who are its ardent critics, and say, “Come with me to the MTC on a Wednesday morning and let’s just watch. Let’s stand together and watch these families say goodbye to their sons and daughters.”

> “**You mean to tell me you think these people are brainwashed?** These individuals and families who in all other walks of life, in their education, in their careers, and in their communities are successful, smart, and industrious – **you mean to tell me in this one area they are so ignorant and brainwashed that they would send away their sons and daughters?**”[^arkellcomment]

> “Never. They would never do it.’

This document attempts to address the question of _why_ many parents are willing to send their children off as LDS missionaries for two years.  Neither parents or their children are "brainwashed" ("brainwashing" wouldn't be the term psychologists would use to describe the motivation behind this kind of event), but they both are the recipients of a signficant level of soclialization that encourages such behavior---and similarly discourages _not_ going on a mission.

## Socialization

The well-respected psychologist of religion, Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi, [explained](https://books.google.com/books?id=EfNTBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=we+take+it+for+granted+benjamin+beit-hallahmi&source=bl&ots=Tgq6kGK3_5&sig=SdRbPV6WkxQBtF0pPubciSq2B60&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi8lPqO95HWAhVD82MKHd7XB4cQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22Social%20learning%2C%20despite%20its%20seeming%20simplicity%22&f=false):

> Social learning, despite its seeming simplicity...remains **the best explanation for most religious actions**.  It is the best explanation for the overall prevalence of religion, for individual religiosity, and for ... the most dramatic of religious acts and movements. ... The variety of religious traditions and the correspondence between the dominant tradition in the social environment and the religious beliefs of the individual are the most obvious proofs to the validity of the social learning approach, which is also able to explain what are considered intense religious experiences.  Supernaturalism is inherently accessible, and children learn just one local version of it and in most cases become inexorably attached to it.

The rest of this document outlines the practices and teachings that contribute to the socialization of Latter-day Saints and would help explain why Latter-day Saint parents are willing to send their 18 and 19 year old children away---and why those young adults are willing to go---for two years to share their religion with others.

### Confession and Accountability

1. [Worthiness interviews are regularly conducted](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3dqj2m/here_are_the_13_questions_lds_bishops_will_ask/).  Those considered unworthy on some level may not be allowed to participate in ordinances, and this may carry some social stigma.  Others may notice if a person does not pass or take the sacrament, for instance.

### Follow the leadership

1. Members are Encouraged to follow leaders, even if they are wrong: "My boy, you always keep your eye on the President of the Church, and if he ever tells you to do anything, and it is wrong, and you do it, the Lord will bless you for it." ([Aaronic Priesthood Manual 3](https://www.lds.org/search?lang=eng&query=%22you+always+keep+your+eye+on+the+President+of+the+Church%22))

1. From an early age, children are taught to [Follow the Prophet](https://www.lds.org/youth/video/follow-the-prophet?lang=eng):

    > At times, following the prophet may be unpopular, but following the prophet is always right. 

    [Videos](https://www.lds.org/youth/video/follow-the-prophet?lang=eng) and [lessons](https://www.lds.org/youth/learn/yw/prophets-revelation/listen?lang=eng) demonstrate the consequences of following or not following the prophet.

    Children often sing the song [Follow the Prophet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcFks_graPQ).

### All life events are tied into the Church

For instance, consider how Church Handbook 2 refers to [a funeral service](https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/meetings-in-the-church/18.6?lang=eng&_r=1#186):

> Funerals provide an important opportunity to teach the gospel and testify of the plan of salvation. They also provide an opportunity to pay tribute to the deceased. However, such tributes should not dominate a funeral service.

And Boyd K. Packer [taught](http://emp.byui.edu/huffr/The%20Unwritten%20Order%20of%20Things%20--%20Boyd%20K.%20Packer.htm):

> When the family insists that several family members speak in a funeral, we hear about the deceased instead of about the Atonement, the Resurrection, and the comforting promises revealed in the scriptures. Now it’s all right to have a family member speak at a funeral, but if they do, their remarks should be in keeping with the spirit of the meeting.

> I have told my Brethren in that day when my funeral is held, if any of them who speak talk about me, I will raise up and correct them. The gospel is to be preached.

Missions, in particular, are considered a "coming of age" experience.  [A mission] bond 
http://www.pbs.org/mormons/themes/mission.html

### Consulting unapproved sources is considered risky

1. Warned against seeking information from unapproved sources (milieu control, doctrine over person):

    > As seekers of truth, our safety lies in asking the right questions, in faith, and of the right sources—meaning those who only speak truth: such as the scriptures, prophets, and the Lord through the Holy Ghost." ([Will You Engage in the Wrestle](http://www.byui.edu/devotionals/sheri-dew)) 

### Encouraged to sacrifice anything to the cause

1. Members often taught to "never turn down a calling" ([example 1](https://www.lds.org/search?lang=eng&query=%22turn+down+a+calling%22), [example 2](https://www.lds.org/liahona/1979/09/follow-the-brethren?lang=eng))

### Members are expected to date and marry other members

Ezra Taft Benson [taught](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1986/10/to-the-young-women-of-the-church?lang=eng):

> Our Heavenly Father wants you to date young men who are faithful members of the Church, who will be worthy to take you to the temple and be married the Lord’s way. There will be a new spirit in Zion when the young women will say to their boyfriends, “If you cannot get a temple recommend, then I am not about to tie my life to you, even for mortality!” And the young returned missionary will say to his girlfriend, “I am sorry, but as much as I love you, I will not marry out of the holy temple.”

Following the Church program is seen as far more important than love, friendship, or spiritual compatibility.

And, young women are consistently taught [that they should marry a returned missionary](http://www.ldsliving.com/Why-I-Didn-t-Marry-an-RM-After-All/s/75872):

> Back when I was in the Young Women program, I remember being told that RM needed to be at the top of my dating criteria list.

The very thought of dating a non-RM is [considered jaw-dropping](http://www.ldsliving.com/Would-You-Date-a-Non-RM/s/71905).

Whom does a young man expect to date and marry if he did not serve a mission, especially given that the majority of his close friends will be LDS?  What kind of social stigma is attached to _not_ serving a mission?

### Some monitoring for orthodoxy occurs

1. Files kept on students at BYU [cataloging activities that may not be in line with LDS thought](http://www.freebyu.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Brad-Carmack-Honor-Code-File.pdf).
1. Existence of a [Strengthening Church Members Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strengthening_Church_Members_Committee).
1. Leaders may be screened for agreement with the status quo.  For instance, the recently leaked [Utah Area Seventies Correlation Meeting](https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/documents/a/a7/Utah_Area_Seventies_Correlation_Meeting-2015-11-11.pdf) states "Stake presidents may want to review this policy [the November 2015 policy excluding children of same-sex married couples] with prospective bishops to determine their willingness to support this policy before extending a call."
1. Leaders may scan social media looking to see if members are properly wearing garments (anecdote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6e8guv/in_case_you_dont_believe_they_are_watching_us/)).  Not likely typical, but nor is such behavior discouraged.
1. LDS leaders may have intercepted private email communication in the past to implicate those communicating with apostate organizations. ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6wfv72/the_strengthening_church_members_committee/))  This is likely atypical behavior.

### Expression of ideas countering orthodoxy may be suppressed

1. Expression of thoughts that run counter to teachings may be silenced in open microphone meetings ([example](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/dd4835cb764c1bc66327645831172705a472684e/documents/threefold-nature-of-the-church/supporting_material/milieu_control/savannahs_testimony.md)).
1. Videos which are critical of the Church have been subject to [concerted copyright take-down attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6cz6wt/thoughts_on_things_and_stuffs_video_channel_was/).
1. Sites with information critical of the LDS Church (e.g., mormonthink.com) [are blocked on wifi in LDS buildings](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2wbuoi/tbm_i_saw_a_link_called_mormonthink_but_the/).
1. In his [talk to CES teachers](https://si.lds.org/bc/seminary/content/library/talks/ces-symposium-addresses/the-mantle-is-far-far-greater-than-the-intellect_eng.pdf) Boyd K. Packer instructed

    > There is a temptation for the writer or the teacher of Church history to want to tell everything, whether it is worthy or faith promoting or not.  Some things that are true are not very useful...In an effort to be objective, impartial, and scholarly, a writer or a teacher may unwittingly be giving equal time to the adversary...The idea that we must be neutral and argue quite as much in favor of the adversary as we do in favor of righteousness is neither reasonable nor safe...It is neither expected nor necessary for us to accommodate those who seek to retrieve references from our sources, distort them, and use them against us."

1. When the prophet speaks, the debate is over: "Now, as he speaks to us … it is as if the Lord Jesus Christ himself were addressing us … Personal opinions vary. Eternal principles never do. When the prophet speaks … the debate is over." ([Aaronic Priesthood Manual 1](https://www.lds.org/manual/aaronic-priesthood-manual-1/lesson-12-following-the-living-prophet?lang=eng&_r=1) (doctrine over person, milieu control)

### Program involves extensive time learning doctrine

1. All high-school youth attend roughly one hour of study in the doctrines and beliefs of the Church nearly every single day of high school.
1. All males are expected to serve a 2 year full-time mission and many females serve a 1.5 year mission.  During this time, missionaries study LDS scripture and related material almost exclusively.
1. Members are taught to pray morning and night individually, with their family, and with their spouses, and study their scriptures daily.
1. Members attend a minimum of 3 hours of Church each Sunday (not counting other meetings like nightly "firesides"), and youth attend a mid-week activity every week.
1. Members are to listen to 10 hours of instruction from Church leadership each half year and carefully review that instruction.

Andersen -- "This is Joseph’s own testimony of what actually occurred. Read it often."

### Members taught to condition themselves into belief

1.  Members are taught that testifying that they know the Church is true is one way to discover their testimony.  Boyd K. Packer [taught](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1983/01/the-candle-of-the-lord?lang=eng):

    > It is not unusual to have a missionary say, “How can I bear testimony until I get one? How can I testify that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that the gospel is true? If I do not have such a testimony, would that not be dishonest?” Oh, if I could teach you this one principle. A testimony is to be found in the bearing of it![^insufficientjustification]

    And Dallin H. Oaks [taught](April 2008 Conference](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/04/testimony?lang=eng):

    > Another way to seek a testimony seems astonishing when compared with the methods of obtaining other knowledge. We gain or strengthen a testimony by bearing it. Someone even suggested that some testimonies are better gained on the feet bearing them than on the knees praying for them.

1. Members have been encouraged to record their testimony, share it with friends, and listen to it regularly.  Niel L. Andersen [taught](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/joseph-smith?lang=eng):

    > Consider recording the testimony of Joseph Smith in your own voice, listening to it regularly, and sharing it with friends. Listening to the Prophet’s testimony in your own voice will help bring the witness you seek.

### Attributing causation to God

1. Leaders regularly attribute supernatural influence [to events others would likely view as natural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph98bvd_DMU).
1. Members regularly attribute natural phenomena to the efficacy of prayer ([example](https://imgur.com/m8UmESh))

### LDS doctrine trumps other ways of knowing

1. All spiritual feelings that contradict the accepted revelations or authorities is not considered revelation from God, [by definition](https://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-and-church-history-gospel-doctrine-teachers-manual/lesson-6-i-will-tell-you-in-your-mind-and-in-your-heart-by-the-holy-ghost?lang=eng)

    > When ... inspiration conveys something out of harmony with the accepted revelations of the Church or contrary to the decisions of its constituted authorities, Latter-day Saints may know that it is not of God, no matter how plausible it may appear.

1. A complete approach [to determining whether the Book of Mormon is true](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/ff97a00079dc519d16807bcaef105a2a03102334/documents/hermetically_sealed_stacked_deck/bom-standalone.pdf) is followed, while alternative hypotheses are never explored.
1. In general, logic is carefully arranged [to support belief](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/ff97a00079dc519d16807bcaef105a2a03102334/documents/hermetically_sealed_stacked_deck/hermetically-sealed-systems-in-lds-thought.pdf).

    [[[ wrong roads example?? ]]]
    should probably detail each of these examples

1. [BYU's Academic Freedom Policy](https://policy.byu.edu/view/index.php?p=9) explains how human reason is subordinate to divine revelation: "Religion offers venerable alternative theories of knowledge by presupposing that truth is eternal, that it is only partly knowable through reason alone, and that human reason must be tested against divine revelation."  Hence, when ways of knowing clash, the authorities win.

## Significant in-group / out-group emphasis

1. Employment with the Church or a Church owned school, visiting the temple, witnessing marriage/sealing ceremonies, all leadership callings, and other temple service is conditioned on 
1. Word of wisdom prohibits the use of drinks that are integral to sociality in most cultures.  FairMormon [writes](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Question:_How_is_the_Word_of_Wisdom_observed_in_the_modern_Church%3F#Question:_How_is_the_Word_of_Wisdom_observed_in_the_modern_Church.3F) (2017-08-28):

    > Adherence to the Word of Wisdom is often a mark of a committed Latter-day Saint and is an outward sign of their separation from the world and their participation in the fellowship of God’s covenant people. Non-observance or observance of the Word of Wisdom often reflects one’s commitment (or lack thereof) to their covenants with God as well as a possible indicator as to how one might approach other commandments.

1. Beards are not allowed for Church employees, at Church owned universities, and for those working in the temple.  Until recently, even those students/employees at BYU of another religious faith who wished to wear a beard for religious reasons [were not allowed to do so](http://www.freebyu.org/byu-adds-religious-exemption-to-beard-policy/).
1. Members [discouraged from getting a tattoo](https://www.lds.org/youth/article/tattoos-and-your-mission?lang=eng).

### Doctrine of "eternal families" encourages in-group association

1. If a family member chooses another religion they will not be with their
   family in the eternities.
1. If a member marries a person of another faith tradition and that person
   never becomes Mormon, the relationships will be split in heaven.

### Words are loaded with insider meaning

1. Use [loaded language](http://www.rationalrevelation.com/tr/loadlang.html): "Court of Love" (disciplinary councils where members may be excommunicated from the Church); "active/less-active"; "apostate" (one who has left the religion for intellectual reasons); "agency" is crucial in LDS thought, but one becomes "captive" by choosing anything other than the LDS path.  "Word of Wisdom" (cannot disobey without being foolish).

### Compartmentalization of information

1. Aspects of the temple are obfuscated or kept secret from the uninitiated.([example 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zE8JKDZazc), [example 2](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-covenants-that-are-made-in-a-Mormon-temple/answer/John-T-Prince?srid=uJIq))
1. Handbook 1 not publicly available.
1. Finances not public since 1959.

### Missions are highly controlled environments

1. The missionary environment, from reading material to schedule, is [_very_ tightly controlled](https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/topics/missionary/MissionaryHandbook2006Navigate.pdf). (milieu control)
1. Father [denied contact information for son](https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/index.php?title=File:Fwd-_Texas_Houston_Mission_Preparedness_Update_for_Hurricane_Harvey_2017-08-26.pdf) serving in Houston during hurricane Harvey.

### Strongly discourages and stigmatizes dissent

1. Those who disagree with orthodox doctrine [are considered either ignorant or proud](https://www.lds.org/manual/teaching-seminary-preservice-readings-religion-370-471-and-475/false-teachings?lang=eng).
1. When the prophet speaks, the debate is over: "Now, as he speaks to us … it is as if the Lord Jesus Christ himself were addressing us … Personal opinions vary. Eternal principles never do. When the prophet speaks … the debate is over." ([Aaronic Priesthood Manual 1](https://www.lds.org/manual/aaronic-priesthood-manual-1/lesson-12-following-the-living-prophet?lang=eng&_r=1)
1. Those who "sin against the Holy Ghost" may be [wiped from existence](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Plan_of_salvation/Sons_of_Perdition/Eventual_fate) as a Son of Perdition.  This is typically downplayed, but the possibility may act to discourage those who have had the strongest spiritual confirmations from considering alternative models of LDS truth-claims.
1. As [taught in recent manuals and official Church material](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/ff97a00079dc519d16807bcaef105a2a03102334/documents/about_apostates/how_those_who_leave_are_viewed.pdf), those who leave the LDS Church become servants of Satan, become darkened and will be burned, will feel guilt and bitterness, left because they transgressed, will experience darkness and unhappiness, become darkened in their minds, are deceived because of their pride, and are deceived by the false teachings of the world.
1. Members are taught to "shun" and "flee" from those who openly disagree with accepted Church doctrine (see [The Shunning Key](https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/the-shunning-key/))

### Orthodoxy tends to trump other considerations

1. [Short engagement/dating times relative to the rest of society](http://byuiscroll.org/long-vs-short-engagements-what-is-the-way-to-go/) suggests that religious affiliation often trumps other considerations of personality and personality compatibility.
1. A good reason not to marry someone [is because they didn't immediately remove extra earrings when the Prophet said to only have one pair](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/david-a-bednar_quick-observe/)

1. Examples of being [bound by eternal covenants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W989ZgIaD3g).
1. [Discussion of the General Conference talk "Whatsoever he saith unto you, Do it."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaqRgMqvie8)

1. Exert general influence on behavior, information, thought, and environment (see [The BITE Model and Mormon Control](http://www.rationalrevelation.com/library/bite.html)) (milieu control)
1. The importance of keeping the commandments is repeatedly emphasized in Latter-day Saint culture, and there is an [extensive list of do's and do not's](http://recoveringagency.com/articles/list-of-lds-commandments/) that members are expected to always be striving to achieve.  Members fall short in various ways and hence are often made to feel [perpetually inadequate](http://recoveringagency.com/articles/the-methods-of-thought-reform/demand-for-purity-perpetual-inadequacy/)



> Mysical experiences, considered unique and individual, are totally culture-dpendent.  We know that the specific content of visions, the most intense and personal of religious acts, is wholly predictable from exposure to certain ideas, which are always learned.  Visions of the Holy Virgin occur exclusively among Catholics or those exposed to Catholic ideas.  They have never occurred among Orthodox Jews...



The book by Luna Lindsey, [Recovering Agency: Lifting the Veil of Mormon Mind Control](http://recoveringagency.com/), gives additional examples and perspective on the topic.  "Thinker of Thoughts" has produced many videos (some with Luna Linsey) exploring aspects of thought-reform and undue influence within the LDS Church (for example, [parallel concepts with scientology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLevx2DAlF-YBazPpn-110Ft0AsC01MrkY) and [undue influence in Oct 2015 General Conference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLevx2DAlF-YDCOcCRWFWDmZesrQe5K0zJ)).  Finally, [Fix your faith crisis with this one weird trick!](http://thoughtsonthingsandstuff.com/fix-your-faith-crisis-with-this-one-weird-trick/) offers perspective on how a practitioner of any religion may ensure they are not succumbing to thought-reform.

## Some cautions

Several caveats and some aditional perspective ought to be rehearsed:

4. One may view the primary mindsets of the LDS Church as [the corporate, the individual growth, and the totalistic](https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/three-fold-nature-lds-church-corporate-totalistic-individual-growth/).  In particular, the individual growth and totalistic mindsets are in some [tension with one another](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/efb593d5c2ee37bc3e4638976331668a33367131/documents/threefold-nature-of-the-church/examples-of-tension-between-individual-growth-and-totalistic-mindsets.pdf).  This means that much of the strong, retentive socialization documented above is softened by the individual growth mindset, and sometimes the corporate mindset.

## Response to typical objections

Some believing members may deny that _any_ level of thought-reform takes place using these kinds of justifications (to which I'll pre-emptively respond):

[^insufficientjustification]: The practice of bearing a testimony to find it may take advantage of the phenomenon of "insufficient justification". [From the 1959 study](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/) on insufficient justification: "If a person is induced to do or say something which is contrary to his private opinion, there will be a tendency for him to change his opinion so as to bring it into correspondence with what he has done or said." ([video which details the experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkJc6c3nKMw) and more on [insufficient justification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufficient_justification))
