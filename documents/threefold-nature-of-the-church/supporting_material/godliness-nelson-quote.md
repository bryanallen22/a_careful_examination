An example of totalistic attitude

[These … Were Our Examples](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1991/10/these-were-our-examples?lang=eng) (Russell M. Nelson, October 1991 GC)

Godliness characterizes each of you who truly loves the Lord. You are constantly mindful of the Savior’s atonement and rejoice in His unconditional love. Meanwhile you vanquish personal pride and vain ambition. You consider your accomplishments important only if they help establish His kingdom on earth.
