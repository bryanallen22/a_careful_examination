> Found some old notes from Gen Conference. Have peace but pay your tithing or you'll burn!! No pressure...

The text says:

Oct. Gen. Conf 2001

- Do not worry about the future.

  Have peace in your heart

- Pay your tithing and you will not be burned in the 2nd coming of Christ.

            -- Pres. Hinkley [sic]
