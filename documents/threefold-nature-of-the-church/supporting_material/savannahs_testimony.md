On May 7, 2017, in a ward somewhere in Eagle Mountain, Utah, a girl named Savannah got up and bore her testimony.  Before she could finish [she was asked/told to sit down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_0nhyP6dU4).  She explains her motivation [here](http://iliketolookforrainbows.com/2017/05/30/episode-2-savannahs-story-the-transcript/).

Here was what she said (statements are numbered for reference):

1. Hi my name is Savannah, and I want to share my testimony with you.
1. I believe I am a child of heavenly parents.
1. I don't know if they talk to us
1. but I feel in my heart that they made me and that they love me.
1. I believe I was made the way I am, all parts of me, by my heavenly parents.
1. They did not mess up when they gave me brown eyes or when I was born bald.
1. They did not mess up when they gave me freckles or when they made me to be gay.
1. God loves me just this way, because I believe that he loves all his creations.

1. I hope to get married and have a family.
1. I know these dreams and wishes are good and right.
1. I know I can have all of these things as a lesbian and be happy.
1. I believe that if God is there, he knows I am perfect, just the way I am.
1. and would never ask me to live my life alone or with someone I am not attracted to.
1. He would want me to be happy.

> Brothers and sisters, I ask you to recognize that we are all children of God, we are loved by our Heavenly Father.  And, I have no doubt that Heavenly Father has made us all unique in different ways and for that I am grateful.  And, I am grateful for all of you that are here today as sons and daughters of God.  And I know very much and I'm grateful for Heavenly Father's plan for us.  And I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

[Conclusion - the rest of what Savannah had prepared but was unable to deliver]

1. I ask that you all pay close attention to what you say, you never know who is listening.
1. I had dreams of going to the temple and getting married, and was very sad when I found out that would never happen for me.
1. Today I choose to find my joy outside of my old dreams from when I was little.  I have new dreams and I know my earthly parents and my Heavenly parents love and accept me just the way I am.  Amen.
