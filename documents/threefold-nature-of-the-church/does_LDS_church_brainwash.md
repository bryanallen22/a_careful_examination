# Does the LDS Church brainwash?

## Introduction

In [A Message To The Most Ardent Critic Of The Mormon Church](http://www.mormonlight.org/2017/08/14/message-ardent-critic-church/), Ben Arkell quotes a nameless member of the church who had recently dropped off their daughter and son at the Missionary Training Center (MTC) (emphasis added):

> “I wish I could go to those who have walked away from the Church, and those who are its ardent critics, and say, “Come with me to the MTC on a Wednesday morning and let’s just watch. Let’s stand together and watch these families say goodbye to their sons and daughters.”

> “**You mean to tell me you think these people are brainwashed?** These individuals and families who in all other walks of life, in their education, in their careers, and in their communities are successful, smart, and industrious – **you mean to tell me in this one area they are so ignorant and brainwashed that they would send away their sons and daughters?**”[^arkellcomment]

> “Never. They would never do it.’

This document addresses the question: Are LDS followers subjected to thought-reform (known colloquially as "brainwashing")?

## What is thought-reform / brainwashing?

Luna Lindsey [provides an excellent introduction to thought-reform](http://recoveringagency.com/), which I will quote at some length:

> The terms “mind control” and “brainwashing” conjure images from the visual gimmicks and cheap plot devices of movies. Truth serums, hypnotic spirals, and torture techniques transform an unwilling victim into a mindless zombie? These are entirely fabricated for your entertainment.

> In real life, a manipulated subject has to be completely unaware that it is happening. She must be in full cooperation with the process, which goes something like this:

> An influencer gains your trust through friendship and promises, perhaps comforting you during a difficult time, and perhaps appealing to your existing ideals. Once you trust him, you’re ready to believe him. You are convinced that everything he says is true and for your own good and for the good of others. Then he has the power to influence all aspects of your life.

> That’s when he teaches you a series of beliefs that will keep you from ever wanting to doubt those teachings or leave his group – even if later those promises are broken or the people turn unfriendly or you end up going against your original ideals.

> Mind control is a type of persuasion that bypasses mental defenses against new beliefs, followed by:

> * establishment of beliefs to deflect all skepticism and criticism of the doctrine and leaders
> * suppression of critical thinking skills (while maintaining the illusion of logic)
> * isolation of members from doubt-inducing information
> * the creation of dependency on the group for social and psychological fulfillment
> * the instillment of emotions like fear and guilt to keep members from leaving.

Researchers generally use the term "thought-reform" when speaking about the kind of influence engaged in by totalistic groups (those with powerful and sweeping ideologies), and that is the term I will use in the remainder of this document to make clear the _type_ of brainwashing to which I am referring.

## Lifton's 8 thought-reform themes 

After studying totalistic groups and the way thought reform is typically implemented within them, Robert Lifton outlined [8 psychological themes which contribute to thought reform in totalistic groups](https://archive.org/stream/ThoughtReformAndThePsychologyOfTotalism/Thought_Reform_and_the_Psychology_of_Totalism#page/n433/mode/2up/search/conversion).  Lifton emphasized that totalism and thought-reform exist on a continuum and that they are closely related:

> The more clearly an evironment expresses these eight psychological themes, the greater its resemblance to ideological totalism; and the more it utilizes such totalist devices to change people, the greater its resemblance to thought reform (or "brainwashing").

The 8 themes [outlined by Lifton](https://archive.org/stream/ThoughtReformAndThePsychologyOfTotalism/Thought_Reform_and_the_Psychology_of_Totalism#page/n433/mode/2up/search/conversion) are:

1. Milieu (environmental) control
2. Mystical Manipulation
3. Demand for Purity (Perpetual Inadequacy)
4. Confession
5. Sacred Science
6. Loading the Language
7. Doctrine Over Person
8. Dispensing of Existence

## LDS teachings or practices evidencing Lifton's themes

Below are teachings and/or cultural practices of the LDS Church which may be considered as fulfilling one or more of Lifton's 8 themes.  Note that counter-examples and [alternative mindsets also exist within the LDS Church](https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/three-fold-nature-lds-church-corporate-totalistic-individual-growth/), so these examples should be weighed in their broader context when possible.  The list is non-exhaustive (many additional examples exist), but should adequately demonstrate the themes:

1. [Worthiness interviews are regularly conducted](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3dqj2m/here_are_the_13_questions_lds_bishops_will_ask/) (demand for purity, milieu control)
1. Bishops may ask very probing questions about sexuality, particularly to those about to serve a mission ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6aotgt/list_of_questions_a_bishop_asks_premissionaries/)). (demand for purity, milieu control)
1. Bishops may ask children as young as 8 years old if they touch themselves ([example](https://bishopsinterview.blogspot.com/?view=classic&m=1)). (demand for purity, milieu control)
1. Bishops may conduct frequent and invasive interviews at their discretion and may use social media to find evidence of indiscretion ([example](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/dd4835cb764c1bc66327645831172705a472684e/documents/threefold-nature-of-the-church/supporting_material/invasive_interviews.md)).
1. In his [talk to CES teachers](https://si.lds.org/bc/seminary/content/library/talks/ces-symposium-addresses/the-mantle-is-far-far-greater-than-the-intellect_eng.pdf) Boyd K. Packer instructed (milieu control):

    > There is a temptation for the writer or the teacher of Church history to want to tell everything, whether it is worthy or faith promoting or not.  Some things that are true are not very useful...In an effort to be objective, impartial, and scholarly, a writer or a teacher may unwittingly be giving equal time to the adversary...The idea that we must be neutral and argue quite as much in favor of the adversary as we do in favor of righteousness is neither reasonable nor safe...It is neither expected nor necessary for us to accommodate those who seek to retrieve references from our sources, distort them, and use them against us."

1. Exert general influence on behavior, information, thought, and environment (see [The BITE Model and Mormon Control](http://www.rationalrevelation.com/library/bite.html)) (milieu control)
1. Encouraged to follow leaders, even if they are wrong: "My boy, you always keep your eye on the President of the Church, and if he ever tells you to do anything, and it is wrong, and you do it, the Lord will bless you for it." ([Aaronic Priesthood Manual 3](https://www.lds.org/search?lang=eng&query=%22you+always+keep+your+eye+on+the+President+of+the+Church%22)) (doctrine over person)
1. Warned against seeking information from unapproved sources (milieu control, doctrine over person):

    > As seekers of truth, our safety lies in asking the right questions, in faith, and of the right sources—meaning those who only speak truth: such as the scriptures, prophets, and the Lord through the Holy Ghost." ([Will You Engage in the Wrestle](http://www.byui.edu/devotionals/sheri-dew)) 

1. Members often taught to "never turn down a calling" ([example 1](https://www.lds.org/search?lang=eng&query=%22turn+down+a+calling%22), [example 2](https://www.lds.org/liahona/1979/09/follow-the-brethren?lang=eng)) (demand for purity, doctrine over person)
1. Beards are not allowed for Church employees, at Church owned universities, and for those working in the temple.  Until recently, even those students/employees at BYU of another religious faith who wished to wear a beard for religious reasons [were not allowed to do so](http://www.freebyu.org/byu-adds-religious-exemption-to-beard-policy/). (demand for purity, doctrine over person, milieu control)
1. Members [discouraged from getting a tattoo](https://www.lds.org/youth/article/tattoos-and-your-mission?lang=eng). (milieu control, demand for purity)
1. Files kept on students at BYU [cataloging activities that may not be in line with LDS thought](http://www.freebyu.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Brad-Carmack-Honor-Code-File.pdf) (milieu control)
1. Existence of a [Strengthening Church Members Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strengthening_Church_Members_Committee) (milieu control)
1. Leaders are screened for agreement with the status quo.  For instance, the recently leaked [Utah Area Seventies Correlation Meeting](https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/documents/a/a7/Utah_Area_Seventies_Correlation_Meeting-2015-11-11.pdf) states "Stake presidents may want to review this policy [the November 2015 policy excluding children of same-sex married couples] with prospective bishops to determine their willingness to support this policy before extending a call." (milieu control)
1. Leaders may scan social media looking to see if members are properly wearing garments (anecdote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6e8guv/in_case_you_dont_believe_they_are_watching_us/)). (milieu control)
1. Expression of thoughts that run counter to teachings may be silenced in open microphone meetings ([example](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/dd4835cb764c1bc66327645831172705a472684e/documents/threefold-nature-of-the-church/supporting_material/milieu_control/savannahs_testimony.md)).
1. Sites with information critical of the LDS Church (e.g., mormonthink.com) [are blocked on wifi in LDS buildings](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2wbuoi/tbm_i_saw_a_link_called_mormonthink_but_the/). (milieu control)
1. Church buildling wifi may be monitored and [offending communication forwarded to ecclesiastical leaders](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2dgzly/institute_tools_institute_gestapo_warning/).
1. Videos which are critical of the Church have been subject to [concerted copyright take-down attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6cz6wt/thoughts_on_things_and_stuffs_video_channel_was/).
1. All high-school youth attend roughly one hour of study in the doctrines and beliefs of the Church nearly every single day of high school.  In addition, all males are expected to serve a 2 year full-time mission and many females serve a 1.5 year mission.  The missionary environment, from reading material to schedule, is [_very_ tightly controlled](https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/topics/missionary/MissionaryHandbook2006Navigate.pdf). (milieu control)
1. Members are taught to pray morning and night individually, with their family, and with their spouses, and study their scriptures daily. (milieu control)
1. Members attend a minimum of 3 hours of Church each Sunday (not counting other meetings like nightly "firesides"), and youth attend a mid-week activity every week. (milieu control)
1. Members are to listen to 10 hours of instruction from Church leadership each half year and carefully review that instruction. (milieu control)
1. Leaders regularly attribute supernatural influence to events others would likely view as natural.  See examples from [Thinker of Thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph98bvd_DMU). (mystical manipulation)
1. Members regularly attribute natural phenomena to the efficacy of prayer ([example](https://imgur.com/m8UmESh)) (mystical manipulation)
1. The importance of keeping the commandments is repeatedly emphasized in Latter-day Saint culture, and there is an [extensive list of do's and do not's](http://recoveringagency.com/articles/list-of-lds-commandments/) that members are expected to always be striving to achieve.  Members fall short in various ways and hence are often made to feel [perpetually inadequate](http://recoveringagency.com/articles/the-methods-of-thought-reform/demand-for-purity-perpetual-inadequacy/) (demand for purity)
1. All major sins [must be confessed to one's LDS leader](https://www.lds.org/new-era/2013/10/why-and-what-do-i-need-to-confess-to-my-bishop?lang=eng).  A leader, at their discretion, _may_ ask an individual to reconfess _all_ past sins to whatever previous point in time they deem relevant ([for example](https://brettsbigbadblog.blogspot.com/2017/06/lds-temple-cancellation-and-clearance.html), "'all transgressions' committed since your first sealing, even those that have already been resolved by church authorities"). (confession)
1. The association between worthiness and missionary success is frequently taught in the MTC and missionaries frequently confess and reconfess all their sins in an effort to become worthy ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2fdcgt/one_of_the_worst_aspects_of_mormon_culture_imo/)). (confession)
1. Some leaders ask youth and adults about their orgasms and sexual positions as they probe regarding masturbation and past sexual transgressions. [testimonials](https://invisiblescubit.wordpress.com/2017/07/04/did-you-orgasm/) (confession)
1. [BYU's Academic Freedom Policy](https://policy.byu.edu/view/index.php?p=9) explains how human reason is subordinate to divine revelation: "Religion offers venerable alternative theories of knowledge by presupposing that truth is eternal, that it is only partly knowable through reason alone, and that human reason must be tested against divine revelation."  Hence, when ways of knowing clash, the authorities win. (sacred science)
1. A complete approach [to determining whether the Book of Mormon is true](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/ff97a00079dc519d16807bcaef105a2a03102334/documents/hermetically_sealed_stacked_deck/bom-standalone.pdf) is followed, while alternative hypotheses are never explored. (sacred science)
1. Logic is carefully arranged [to support belief](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/ff97a00079dc519d16807bcaef105a2a03102334/documents/hermetically_sealed_stacked_deck/hermetically-sealed-systems-in-lds-thought.pdf). (sacred science)
1. Elder David Bednar was heard to say ["I am scripture"](http://anonymousbishop.com/2015/08/10/i-am-scripture/). (sacred science)
1. Use [loaded language](http://www.rationalrevelation.com/tr/loadlang.html): "Court of Love" (disciplinary councils where members may be excommunicated from the Church); "active/less-active"; "apostate" (one who has left the religion for intellectual reasons); "agency" is crucial in LDS thought, but one becomes "captive" by choosing anything other than the LDS path.  "Word of Wisdom" (cannot disobey without being foolish) (loading the language)
1. All spiritual feelings that contradict the accepted revelations or authorities is not considered revelation from God, [by definition](https://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-and-church-history-gospel-doctrine-teachers-manual/lesson-6-i-will-tell-you-in-your-mind-and-in-your-heart-by-the-holy-ghost?lang=eng) (sacred science, doctrine over person)

    > When ... inspiration conveys something out of harmony with the accepted revelations of the Church or contrary to the decisions of its constituted authorities, Latter-day Saints may know that it is not of God, no matter how plausible it may appear.

1. Those who disagree with orthodox doctrine [are considered either ignorant or proud](https://www.lds.org/manual/teaching-seminary-preservice-readings-religion-370-471-and-475/false-teachings?lang=eng) (doctrine over person)
1. [Short engagement/dating times relative to the rest of society](http://byuiscroll.org/long-vs-short-engagements-what-is-the-way-to-go/) suggests that religious affiliation often trumps other considerations of personality and personality compatibility. (doctrine over person)
1. A good reason not to marry someone [is because they didn't immediately remove extra earrings when the Prophet said to only have one pair](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/david-a-bednar_quick-observe/) (doctrine over person, milieu control)
1. Members are taught to "shun" and "flee" from those who openly disagree with accepted Church doctrine (see [The Shunning Key](https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/the-shunning-key/)) (doctrine over person, dispensing of existence)
1. Those who "sin against the Holy Ghost" may be [wiped from existence](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Plan_of_salvation/Sons_of_Perdition/Eventual_fate) as a Son of Perdition. (dispensing of existence)
1. As [taught in recent manuals and official Church material](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/ff97a00079dc519d16807bcaef105a2a03102334/documents/about_apostates/how_those_who_leave_are_viewed.pdf), those who leave the LDS Church become servants of Satan, become darkened and will be burned, will feel guilt and bitterness, left because they transgressed, will experience darkness and unhappiness, become darkened in their minds, are deceived because of their pride, and are deceived by the false teachings of the world. (dispensing of existence, doctrine over person)
1. When the prophet speaks, the debate is over: "Now, as he speaks to us … it is as if the Lord Jesus Christ himself were addressing us … Personal opinions vary. Eternal principles never do. When the prophet speaks … the debate is over." ([Aaronic Priesthood Manual 1](https://www.lds.org/manual/aaronic-priesthood-manual-1/lesson-12-following-the-living-prophet?lang=eng&_r=1) (doctrine over person, milieu control)
1. Misleading members about the connection [between Lorenzo Snow, tithing, and rainfall](http://mormonarts.lib.byu.edu/works/windows-of-heaven). (milieu control, mystical manipulation)
1. Aspects of the temple are obfuscated or kept secret from the uninitiated.([example 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zE8JKDZazc), [example 2](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-covenants-that-are-made-in-a-Mormon-temple/answer/John-T-Prince?srid=uJIq)) (milieu control)

The book by Luna Lindsey, [Recovering Agency: Lifting the Veil of Mormon Mind Control](http://recoveringagency.com/), gives additional examples and perspective on the topic.  In addition, [Fix your faith crisis with this one weird trick!](http://thoughtsonthingsandstuff.com/fix-your-faith-crisis-with-this-one-weird-trick/) offers perspective on how a practitioner of any religion may ensure they are not succumbing to thought-reform.

## Some cautions

Several caveats and some aditional perspective ought to be rehearsed:

1. Admittedly, more extreme examples of thought-reform methods are present in more extreme totalistic groups.  However, the question I was addressing was not "Are LDS followers subjected to _extreme_ thought-reform?" but rather are they subjected to it _at all_?
2. A person's LDS experience may differ depending on when they joined the LDS Church and in which unit(s) they experienced LDS living.  In addition, a single individual is unlikely to have experienced all the above examples.
3. It is unlikely that any of these practices or attitudes were "designed" with thought-reform in mind---thought reform techniques evolve in tandem with strong totalistic missions and tend to be effective so they are naturally selected for within high-demand and totalistic groups.  In addition, these themes or techniques are often implemented and encouraged by the members themselves (not necessarily imposed in a top-down fashion).
4. One may view the primary mindsets of the LDS Church as [the corporate, the individual growth, and the totalistic](https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/three-fold-nature-lds-church-corporate-totalistic-individual-growth/).  In particular, the individual growth and totalistic mindsets are in some [tension with one another](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/efb593d5c2ee37bc3e4638976331668a33367131/documents/threefold-nature-of-the-church/examples-of-tension-between-individual-growth-and-totalistic-mindsets.pdf).  As alluded to earlier, this means that much of the totalistic/thought-reform behavior documented above is softened in practice by an individual growth mindset, and sometimes the corporate mindset.

## Response to typical objections

Some believing members may deny that _any_ level of thought-reform takes place using these kinds of justifications (to which I'll pre-emptively respond):

1. Examples may not be considered extreme enough to be classified as "thought-reform" (it's just "teaching").  _Response:_ teachings and practices need not be extreme to promote thought-reform.
2. Extreme examples may be dismissed as merely _mistakes in the implementation_ of nearly perfect Church programs.  _Response:_ there are often underlying doctrines and teachings justifying the extreme examples (i.e., the behaviors may be extreme but they were fostered by the Church's teachings, practices, or structure).  Extreme examples were chosen because they _exemplify_ or cast relief on core Church attitudes, not because they run counter to them.
3. The LDS Church operates in a manner similar to Jesus Christ's early Church, so how can these practices be called "thought-reform".  _Response:_ Comparing LDS teachings or practices to those of the early Church does not necessarily exonerate the LDS Church because the early Church itself may have been using some of the same techniques or themes associated with thought-reform (see, for example, [2 John 1:7-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+John+7-11&version=KJV)).
4. The level of influence being exerted is the appropriate level given the importance of the topic (e.g., everyone would act in that manner if they knew how important "xyz" really was).  _Response:_ Lifton is responding to specific kinds of behavior which rob people of the full latitude of choice and these may be evaluated independently of the mission's importance.  In fact, those who engage in thought-reform tend to feel they have missions of great importance and that provides justification for their behavior.
5. Compliance in small things is a necessary part in becoming obedient to the more significant commandments.  _Response:_ These kinds of defenses are a _manifestation_ of typical thought-reform attitudes, not a defense against them.

[^arkellcomment]: I submitted the following comment in response to Ben Arkell's article:

    > You mean to tell me you think these people are brainwashed?

    Yes. The evidence for mild to medium thought-reform in the LDS Church is
    substantial (followed by a link to this document).
