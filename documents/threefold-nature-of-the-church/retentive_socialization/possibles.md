## Miscellaneous (UNCLASSIFIED so far)

1. Examples of [blame reversal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoSyBBBtZgY).
1. [Discussion of the General Conference talk "Whatsoever he saith unto you, Do it."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaqRgMqvie8)
1. Examples and discussion of [milieu control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7HFSClydA0).
1. Exert general influence on behavior, information, thought, and environment (see [The BITE Model and Mormon Control](http://www.rationalrevelation.com/library/bite.html))
1. The importance of keeping the commandments is repeatedly emphasized in Latter-day Saint culture, and there is an [extensive list of do's and do not's](http://recoveringagency.com/articles/list-of-lds-commandments/) that members are expected to always be striving to achieve.  Members fall short in various ways and hence are often made to feel [perpetually inadequate](http://recoveringagency.com/articles/the-methods-of-thought-reform/demand-for-purity-perpetual-inadequacy/)

The book by Luna Lindsey, [Recovering Agency: Lifting the Veil of Mormon Mind Control](http://recoveringagency.com/), gives additional examples and perspective on the topic.  "Thinker of Thoughts" has produced many videos (some with Luna Linsey) exploring aspects of thought-reform and undue influence within the LDS Church (for example, [parallel concepts with scientology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLevx2DAlF-YBazPpn-110Ft0AsC01MrkY) and [undue influence in Oct 2015 General Conference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLevx2DAlF-YDCOcCRWFWDmZesrQe5K0zJ)).  Finally, [Fix your faith crisis with this one weird trick!](http://thoughtsonthingsandstuff.com/fix-your-faith-crisis-with-this-one-weird-trick/) offers perspective on how a practitioner of any religion may ensure they are not succumbing to thought-reform.

## Different mindsets

One may view the primary mindsets of the LDS Church as [the corporate, the individual growth, and the totalistic](https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/three-fold-nature-lds-church-corporate-totalistic-individual-growth/).  In particular, the individual growth and totalistic mindsets are in some [tension with one another](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/efb593d5c2ee37bc3e4638976331668a33367131/documents/threefold-nature-of-the-church/examples-of-tension-between-individual-growth-and-totalistic-mindsets.pdf).  This means that much of the strong, retentive socialization documented above is softened by the individual growth mindset, and sometimes the corporate mindset.
