# Retentive Socialization and Indoctrination

## Introduction

In [A Message To The Most Ardent Critic Of The Mormon Church](http://www.mormonlight.org/2017/08/14/message-ardent-critic-church/), Ben Arkell quotes a nameless member of the church who had recently dropped off their daughter and son at the Missionary Training Center (MTC) (emphasis added):

> “I wish I could go to those who have walked away from the Church, and those who are its ardent critics, and say, “Come with me to the MTC on a Wednesday morning and let’s just watch. Let’s stand together and watch these families say goodbye to their sons and daughters.”

> “**You mean to tell me you think these people are brainwashed?** These individuals and families who in all other walks of life, in their education, in their careers, and in their communities are successful, smart, and industrious – **you mean to tell me in this one area they are so ignorant and brainwashed that they would send away their sons and daughters?**”[^arkellcomment]

> “Never. They would never do it.’

This document attempts to _broadly_ address the question of _why_ many parents are willing to send their children off as LDS missionaries for two years.  Neither parents or their children are "brainwashed" ("brainwashing" wouldn't be the term psychologists would use to describe the processes motivating this kind of action), but they both are the recipients of a signficant level of socialization, and socialization is a powerful force for encouraging and discouraging certain behaviors.

## Socialization

The well-respected psychologist of religion, Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi, [explained](https://books.google.com/books?id=EfNTBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=we+take+it+for+granted+benjamin+beit-hallahmi&source=bl&ots=Tgq6kGK3_5&sig=SdRbPV6WkxQBtF0pPubciSq2B60&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi8lPqO95HWAhVD82MKHd7XB4cQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22Social%20learning%2C%20despite%20its%20seeming%20simplicity%22&f=false):

> Social learning, despite its seeming simplicity...remains **the best explanation for most religious actions**.  It is the best explanation for the overall prevalence of religion, for individual religiosity, and for ... the most dramatic of religious acts and movements. ... The variety of religious traditions and the correspondence between the dominant tradition in the social environment and the religious beliefs of the individual are the most obvious proofs to the validity of the social learning approach, which is also able to explain what are considered intense religious experiences.  Supernaturalism is inherently accessible, and children learn just one local version of it and in most cases become inexorably attached to it.

This document outlines the practices and teachings that contribute to the socialization of Latter-day Saints and would help explain why Latter-day Saint parents are willing to send their 18 and 19 year old children away---and why those young adults are willing to go---for roughly two years to share their religion with others.  Positive desires to share and to serve motivate many young Latter-day Saints to serve, but the negative repurcussions a young person might experience by _not_ serving a mission is likely woven into the motivation many experience.  Both the positive and negative drives may be considered two sides of the same socializing influence coin.

### Tragic, disastrous consequences for not following

Although the consequences are [often unnamed](https://youtu.be/mmErOV9oQZ8?t=222), the implication is that not following the LDS program results in consequences that are always tragic.  For instance, M. Russell Ballard [taught](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/stay-in-the-boat-and-hold-on?lang=eng): 

> they leave the Old Ship Zion—they fall away; they apostatize. Tragically, they often experience short-term and eventually long-term unintended consequences, not only for themselves but also for their families.

Following every part of the LDS program is seen as vitally important for safety.  For instance, Julie Beck tells the story of how drinking coffee was the primary reason her family fell away from the LDS Church even though they were following the other prescribed activities of paying tithing and Sunday worship:

> My next story is about a woman I will call Mary. She was the daughter of faithful pioneer parents who had sacrificed much for the gospel. She had been married in the temple and was the mother of 10 children. She was a talented woman who taught her children how to pray, to work hard, and to love each other. She paid her tithing, and the family rode to church together on Sunday in their wagon.

> Though she knew it was contrary to the Word of Wisdom, she developed the habit of drinking coffee and kept a coffee pot on the back of her stove. She claimed that “the Lord will not keep me out of heaven for a little cup of coffee.” But, because of that little cup of coffee, she could not qualify for a temple recommend, and neither could those of her children who drank coffee with her. Though she lived to a good old age and did eventually qualify to reenter and serve in the temple, only one of her 10 children had a worthy temple marriage, and a great number of her posterity, which is now in its fifth generation, live outside of the blessings of the restored gospel she believed in and her forefathers sacrificed so much for.

D&C 84:41 reminds all those with the Melchizedek Priesthood (which virtually all male members receive at the age of 18):

> But whoso breaketh this covenant after he hath received it, and altogether turneth therefrom, shall not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to come.

And members are reminded that those who break the marriage covenant will experience "eternal misery" (Eternal Marraige Student Manual: [Covenants and Ordinances](https://www.lds.org/manual/eternal-marriage-student-manual/covenants-and-ordinances?lang=eng)).

The Covenants and Ordinances chapter of the Eternal Marriage Student manual [begins with this quote](https://www.lds.org/manual/eternal-marriage-student-manual/covenants-and-ordinances?lang=eng) by Boyd K. Packer:

> Keep your covenants and you will be safe. Break them and you will not.

### Confession and Accountability

[Worthiness interviews are regularly conducted](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3dqj2m/here_are_the_13_questions_lds_bishops_will_ask/).  Those considered unworthy on some level may not be allowed to participate in ordinances, and this may carry some social stigma.  Others may notice if a person does not pass or take the sacrament, for instance.

Interviews occur at expected intervals and can lead to intense pressure to conform to the LDS program.  Consider, for instance, the pressure to conform felt by [Kip Eliason](http://thoughtsonthingsandstuff.com/a-latter-day-tragedy-suicide-over-masturbation/) and Steven ([as related by NewNameNoah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xliwswh4GGU) [warning: last half contains explicit temple references]).  NewNameNoah took [hidden-camera footage of his adult worthiness interview](https://youtu.be/4DCeAK6vUb8?t=260) [warning: video may be offensive to LDS members].

Leaders [were recently instructed](https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/index.php?title=File:Area_Council_Meeting_Minutes_-_January-2016-02-10.pdf)):

> Worthiness interviews need to be **specific** and **explicit** (emphasis added)

Although questions are prescribed and must be asked word-for-word, ecclesiastical leaders are given some latitude in how to conduct the interview, particularly when the answer runs counter to the approved answer.[^invasive_interviews]

### No viable alternative

Jeffery R. Holland [taught](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me?lang=eng): "We board the Good Ship Zion and sail with her wherever she goes until she comes into that millennial port. We stay in the boat, through squalls and stills, through storms and sunburn, because that is the only way to the promised land." Also captured [in this meme](https://i.redd.it/clkz8lb9uukz.jpg).

M Russell Ballard [taught](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2016/10/to-whom-shall-we-go?lang=eng): "If you choose to become inactive or to leave the restored Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where will you go? What will you do? The decision to 'walk no more' with Church members and the Lord’s chosen leaders will have a long-term impact that cannot always be seen right now."

### Always follow the leadership

Members are taught that their eternal safety lies in always following their LDS leadership and that their leadership represents God to them.  [D&C 1:38](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.38f?lang=eng) emphasizes this equivalency:

> What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.

And [D&C 21:4-5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/21.4-5):

> 4 Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;

> 5 For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.

Following the prophet is repeatedly and emphatically taught to young children and teenagers in the LDS Church.  Toddlers and very young children often sing the song [Follow the Prophet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcFks_graPQ).  Youth are encouraged to follow leaders, [even if they were wrong on something](https://www.lds.org/search?lang=eng&query=%22you+always+keep+your+eye+on+the+President+of+the+Church%22):

> My boy, you always keep your eye on the President of the Church, and if he ever tells you to do anything, and it is wrong, and you do it, the Lord will bless you for it.

[Videos](https://www.lds.org/youth/video/follow-the-prophet?lang=eng) and [lessons](https://www.lds.org/youth/learn/yw/prophets-revelation/listen?lang=eng) demonstrate the consequences of following or not following the prophet, and the message is typically taught in [absolute terms](https://www.lds.org/youth/video/follow-the-prophet?lang=eng):

> At times, following the prophet may be unpopular, but following the prophet is always right. 

### Most major life events are tied into the Church

Given that religions offer a scaffold of meaning, it makes sense that they would be involved in most major life events.

Newborn babies are typically blessed in front of the congregation.  Children are baptized members at age eight (again, typically by the Father) at what is considered the "age of accountability".  Young men receive the priesthood (typically conferred by the Father) at age 12, advance in Priesthood rank at 14, again at 16 and typically receive the higher Priesthood at age 18.  The father must be [considered worthy by the Bishop](http://www.mormonthink.com/glossary/templerecommend.htm) to perform these ordinances, and there is some communal shame imparted or at least implied if they are unable to do so.  Fathers typically give a school blessing before the start of each school year.

In each of these cases, the Father is expected to perform the ordinance, but he must be [considered worthy by the Bishop](http://www.mormonthink.com/glossary/templerecommend.htm) in order to do so.  Some sense of shame is usually imparted or imagined by the father if they are unable to perform the ordinance because of lack of worthiness.

LDS missions themselves are considered [a "coming of age" experience](http://www.pbs.org/mormons/themes/mission.html) (see answer by D. Michael Quinn).

Marriage in an LDS temple is given _strong_ emphasis in the Church since it is viewed as the only way for the marriage to endure in the eternities.  All other marriage ceremonies are viewed as counterfeit, at least to some degree.

Funerals are considered a time to teach the Gospel and reinforce the LDS conception of life's purpose.  For instance, [Church Handbook 2 instructs](https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/meetings-in-the-church/18.6?lang=eng&_r=1#186):

> Funerals provide an important opportunity to teach the gospel and testify of the plan of salvation. They also provide an opportunity to pay tribute to the deceased. However, such tributes should not dominate a funeral service.

And Boyd K. Packer [taught](http://emp.byui.edu/huffr/The%20Unwritten%20Order%20of%20Things%20--%20Boyd%20K.%20Packer.htm):

> When the family insists that several family members speak in a funeral, we hear about the deceased instead of about the Atonement, the Resurrection, and the comforting promises revealed in the scriptures. Now it’s all right to have a family member speak at a funeral, but if they do, their remarks should be in keeping with the spirit of the meeting.

> I have told my Brethren in that day when my funeral is held, if any of them who speak talk about me, I will raise up and correct them. The gospel is to be preached.

### Consulting unapproved sources is considered risky

Members are warned against seeking information from unapproved sources:

> As seekers of truth, our safety lies in asking the right questions, in faith, and of the right sources—meaning those who only speak truth: such as the scriptures, prophets, and the Lord through the Holy Ghost." ([Will You Engage in the Wrestle](http://www.byui.edu/devotionals/sheri-dew))

### Encouraged to sacrifice anything to the cause

1. Members often taught to "never turn down a calling" ([example 1](https://www.lds.org/search?lang=eng&query=%22turn+down+a+calling%22), [example 2](https://www.lds.org/liahona/1979/09/follow-the-brethren?lang=eng))

May be discouraged from any activity that would disrupt Church duties:

https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/78nkbr/but_while_youre_on_your_dream_adventure_how_will/

> I planned for years on going for a solo backpacking & hitchhiking adventure around the country. Finally one summer, the conditions were right, I had nothing else I needed to do, and I realized it was then or never. It was time to accomplish a dream.

> When my bishop at the time found out, he sat me down for the most intense church interview I'd had up to that point in my life. His core question was how I intended to fulfill my home teaching and other priesthood duties if I went on my adventure.

Every LDS person marrying in the temple or serving a mission _must_ receive their endowment.  In this ceremony they promise to:

> observe and keep the Law of Sacrifice, as contained in the Old and New Testament [as Jesus Christ has laid down his life for the redemption of mankind, so we should covenant to sacrifice all that we possess, even our own lives if necessary, in sustaining and defending the Kingdom of God]

and to:

> consecrate yourselves, your time, talents, and everything with which the Lord has blessed you, or with which he may bless you, to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for the building up of the Kingdom of God on the earth and for the establishment of Zion

### Members are expected to date and marry other members

Ezra Taft Benson [taught](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1986/10/to-the-young-women-of-the-church?lang=eng):

> Our Heavenly Father wants you to date young men who are faithful members of the Church, who will be worthy to take you to the temple and be married the Lord’s way. There will be a new spirit in Zion when the young women will say to their boyfriends, “If you cannot get a temple recommend, then I am not about to tie my life to you, even for mortality!” And the young returned missionary will say to his girlfriend, “I am sorry, but as much as I love you, I will not marry out of the holy temple.”

Following the Church program is seen as far more important than love, friendship, or spiritual compatibility.

And, young women are consistently taught [that they should marry a returned missionary](http://www.ldsliving.com/Why-I-Didn-t-Marry-an-RM-After-All/s/75872):

> Back when I was in the Young Women program, I remember being told that RM needed to be at the top of my dating criteria list.

The very thought of dating a non-RM is [considered jaw-dropping](http://www.ldsliving.com/Would-You-Date-a-Non-RM/s/71905).

Whom does a young man expect to date and marry if he did not serve a mission, especially given that the majority of his close friends will be LDS?  What kind of social stigma is attached to _not_ serving a mission?

### Some monitoring for orthodoxy occurs

1. Files kept on students at BYU [cataloging activities that may not be in line with LDS thought](http://www.freebyu.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Brad-Carmack-Honor-Code-File.pdf).
1. Existence of a [Strengthening Church Members Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strengthening_Church_Members_Committee).
1. Leaders may be screened for agreement with the status quo.  For instance, the recently leaked [Utah Area Seventies Correlation Meeting](https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/documents/a/a7/Utah_Area_Seventies_Correlation_Meeting-2015-11-11.pdf) states "Stake presidents may want to review this policy [the November 2015 policy excluding children of same-sex married couples] with prospective bishops to determine their willingness to support this policy before extending a call."
1. Leaders may scan social media looking to see if members are properly wearing garments (anecdote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6e8guv/in_case_you_dont_believe_they_are_watching_us/)).  Not likely typical, but nor is such behavior discouraged.
1. LDS leaders may have intercepted private email communication in the past to implicate those communicating with apostate organizations. ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6wfv72/the_strengthening_church_members_committee/))  This is likely atypical behavior.

### Expression of ideas countering orthodoxy may be suppressed

1. Expression of thoughts that run counter to teachings may be silenced in open microphone meetings ([example](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/dd4835cb764c1bc66327645831172705a472684e/documents/threefold-nature-of-the-church/supporting_material/milieu_control/savannahs_testimony.md)).
1. Videos which are critical of the Church have been subject to [concerted copyright take-down attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6cz6wt/thoughts_on_things_and_stuffs_video_channel_was/).
1. Sites with information critical of the LDS Church (e.g., mormonthink.com) [are blocked on wifi in LDS buildings](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2wbuoi/tbm_i_saw_a_link_called_mormonthink_but_the/).
1. In his [talk to CES teachers](https://si.lds.org/bc/seminary/content/library/talks/ces-symposium-addresses/the-mantle-is-far-far-greater-than-the-intellect_eng.pdf) Boyd K. Packer instructed

    > There is a temptation for the writer or the teacher of Church history to want to tell everything, whether it is worthy or faith promoting or not.  Some things that are true are not very useful...In an effort to be objective, impartial, and scholarly, a writer or a teacher may unwittingly be giving equal time to the adversary...The idea that we must be neutral and argue quite as much in favor of the adversary as we do in favor of righteousness is neither reasonable nor safe...It is neither expected nor necessary for us to accommodate those who seek to retrieve references from our sources, distort them, and use them against us."

1. When the prophet speaks, the debate is over: "Now, as he speaks to us … it is as if the Lord Jesus Christ himself were addressing us … Personal opinions vary. Eternal principles never do. When the prophet speaks … the debate is over." ([Aaronic Priesthood Manual 1](https://www.lds.org/manual/aaronic-priesthood-manual-1/lesson-12-following-the-living-prophet?lang=eng&_r=1)

### Program involves extensive time learning doctrine

1. All high-school youth attend roughly one hour of study in the doctrines and beliefs of the Church nearly every single day of high school.
1. All males are expected to serve a 2 year full-time mission and many females serve a 1.5 year mission.  During this time, missionaries study LDS scripture and related material almost exclusively.
1. Members are taught to pray morning and night individually, with their family, and with their spouses, and study their scriptures daily.
1. Members attend a minimum of 3 hours of Church each Sunday (not counting other meetings like nightly "firesides"), and youth attend a mid-week activity every week.
1. Members are to listen to 10 hours of instruction from Church leadership each half year and carefully review that instruction.

### Members taught to condition themselves into belief

1.  Members are taught that testifying that they know the Church is true is one way to discover their testimony.  Boyd K. Packer [taught](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1983/01/the-candle-of-the-lord?lang=eng):

    > It is not unusual to have a missionary say, “How can I bear testimony until I get one? How can I testify that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that the gospel is true? If I do not have such a testimony, would that not be dishonest?” Oh, if I could teach you this one principle. A testimony is to be found in the bearing of it![^insufficientjustification]

    And Dallin H. Oaks [taught](April 2008 Conference](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/04/testimony?lang=eng):

    > Another way to seek a testimony seems astonishing when compared with the methods of obtaining other knowledge. We gain or strengthen a testimony by bearing it. Someone even suggested that some testimonies are better gained on the feet bearing them than on the knees praying for them.

1. Members have been encouraged to record their testimony, share it with friends, and listen to it regularly.  Niel L. Andersen [taught](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/joseph-smith?lang=eng):

    > Consider recording the testimony of Joseph Smith in your own voice, listening to it regularly, and sharing it with friends. Listening to the Prophet’s testimony in your own voice will help bring the witness you seek.

### Attributing causation to God

1. Leaders regularly attribute supernatural influence [to events others would likely view as natural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph98bvd_DMU).
1. Members regularly attribute natural phenomena to the efficacy of prayer ([example](https://imgur.com/m8UmESh))

Hence, a Latter-day Saint persistently sees God's hand influencing their life in significant and insignificant ways.

### LDS doctrine trumps other ways of knowing

1. All spiritual feelings that contradict the accepted revelations or authorities is not considered revelation from God, [by definition](https://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-and-church-history-gospel-doctrine-teachers-manual/lesson-6-i-will-tell-you-in-your-mind-and-in-your-heart-by-the-holy-ghost?lang=eng)

    > When ... inspiration conveys something out of harmony with the accepted revelations of the Church or contrary to the decisions of its constituted authorities, Latter-day Saints may know that it is not of God, no matter how plausible it may appear.

1. A complete approach [to determining whether the Book of Mormon is true](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/ff97a00079dc519d16807bcaef105a2a03102334/documents/hermetically_sealed_stacked_deck/bom-standalone.pdf) is followed, while alternative hypotheses are never explored.
1. In general, logic is carefully arranged [to support belief](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/ff97a00079dc519d16807bcaef105a2a03102334/documents/hermetically_sealed_stacked_deck/hermetically-sealed-systems-in-lds-thought.pdf).
1. [BYU's Academic Freedom Policy](https://policy.byu.edu/view/index.php?p=9) explains how human reason is subordinate to divine revelation: "Religion offers venerable alternative theories of knowledge by presupposing that truth is eternal, that it is only partly knowable through reason alone, and that human reason must be tested against divine revelation."  Hence, when ways of knowing clash, the authorities win.

## Significant in-group / out-group emphasis

1. Employment with the Church or a Church owned school, visiting the temple, witnessing marriage/sealing ceremonies, all leadership callings, and other temple service is conditioned on [worthiness interviews](http://www.mormonthink.com/glossary/templerecommend.htm).
1. The Word of Wisdom prohibits the use of drinks that are integral to sociality in most cultures.  FairMormon [writes](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Question:_How_is_the_Word_of_Wisdom_observed_in_the_modern_Church%3F#Question:_How_is_the_Word_of_Wisdom_observed_in_the_modern_Church.3F) (2017-08-28):

    > Adherence to the Word of Wisdom is often a mark of a committed Latter-day Saint and is an outward sign of their separation from the world and their participation in the fellowship of God’s covenant people. Non-observance or observance of the Word of Wisdom often reflects one’s commitment (or lack thereof) to their covenants with God as well as a possible indicator as to how one might approach other commandments.

1. Beards are not allowed for Church employees, at Church owned universities, and for those working in the temple.  Until recently, even those students/employees at BYU of another religious faith who wished to wear a beard for religious reasons [were not allowed to do so](http://www.freebyu.org/byu-adds-religious-exemption-to-beard-policy/).
1. Members [discouraged from getting a tattoo](https://www.lds.org/youth/article/tattoos-and-your-mission?lang=eng).
1. Members use [insider and loaded language](http://www.rationalrevelation.com/tr/loadlang.html): "Court of Love" (disciplinary councils where members may be excommunicated from the Church); "active/less-active"; "apostate" (one who has left the religion for intellectual reasons); "agency" is crucial in LDS thought, but one becomes "captive" by choosing anything other than the LDS path.  "Word of Wisdom" (cannot disobey without being foolish).

### Doctrine of "eternal families" encourages in-group association

1. If a family member chooses another religion they will not be with their family in the eternities.
1. If a member marries a person of another faith tradition and that person never becomes Mormon, the relationships will be split in heaven.

### Compartmentalization of information

1. Aspects of the temple are obfuscated or kept secret from the uninitiated.([example 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zE8JKDZazc), [example 2](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-covenants-that-are-made-in-a-Mormon-temple/answer/John-T-Prince?srid=uJIq))
1. Handbook 1 not publicly available.
1. Finances not public since 1959.
1. Permission for being sealed to a second wife in the temple [is handled in secret](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/7a6w96/100_undeniable_proof_that_the_church_of_jesus/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=exmormon). [Legally, the person may only be married to one person at a time, but a man may be sealed to more than one living woman at a time]

### Missions are highly controlled, socializing environments

1. The missionary environment, from reading material to schedule, is [_very_ tightly controlled](https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/topics/missionary/MissionaryHandbook2006Navigate.pdf).
1. Mission presidents may use an extraordinary number of tactics and gates (~21) to prevent homesick or discouraged missionaries from returning home.[^avoid_early_release_tactics]  This includes requiring the missionary or their family to pay for their own flight home (regardless of whether the missionary or family pre-paid for their mission).  Mission Presidents also tend to hold missionaries' passports so the missionary may not leave without their permission.[^passports]  Missionaries must also sign a document stating their intention to serve, [which may be used against them](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2qlcqk/21_the_number_of_methods_and_gates_a_mission/cn77unk/) if they decide to return home (i.e., "you signed up for this.")
1. Father [denied contact information for son](https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/index.php?title=File:Fwd-_Texas_Houston_Mission_Preparedness_Update_for_Hurricane_Harvey_2017-08-26.pdf) serving in Houston during hurricane Harvey.

### Strongly discourages and stigmatizes dissent

1. Those who disagree with orthodox doctrine [are considered either ignorant or proud](https://www.lds.org/manual/teaching-seminary-preservice-readings-religion-370-471-and-475/false-teachings?lang=eng).
1. When the prophet speaks, the debate is over: "Now, as he speaks to us … it is as if the Lord Jesus Christ himself were addressing us … Personal opinions vary. Eternal principles never do. When the prophet speaks … the debate is over." ([Aaronic Priesthood Manual 1](https://www.lds.org/manual/aaronic-priesthood-manual-1/lesson-12-following-the-living-prophet?lang=eng&_r=1)
1. Those who "sin against the Holy Ghost" may be [wiped from existence](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Plan_of_salvation/Sons_of_Perdition/Eventual_fate) as a Son of Perdition.  This is typically downplayed, but the possibility may act to discourage those who have had the strongest spiritual confirmations from considering alternative models of LDS truth-claims.
1. As [taught in recent manuals and official Church material](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/ff97a00079dc519d16807bcaef105a2a03102334/documents/about_apostates/how_those_who_leave_are_viewed.pdf), those who leave the LDS Church become servants of Satan, become darkened and will be burned, will feel guilt and bitterness, left because they transgressed, will experience darkness and unhappiness, become darkened in their minds, are deceived because of their pride, and are deceived by the false teachings of the world.
   

1. Members are taught to "shun" and "flee" from those who openly disagree with accepted Church doctrine (see [The Shunning Key](https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/the-shunning-key/))

### Orthodoxy tends to trump other considerations

1. [Short engagement/dating times relative to the rest of society](http://byuiscroll.org/long-vs-short-engagements-what-is-the-way-to-go/) suggests that religious affiliation often trumps other considerations of personality and personality compatibility.
1. A good reason not to marry someone [is because they didn't immediately remove extra earrings when the Prophet said to only have one pair](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/david-a-bednar_quick-observe/)
1. Some Leaders create [contracts to ensure continued activity](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/4w2g89/followup_returned_missionary_indoctrination_the/).

## Conclusion

A tremendous number of cultural factors align to encourage members to stay members.

## Miscellaneous (UNCLASSIFIED so far)

1. Examples of [blame reversal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoSyBBBtZgY).
1. Examples of being [bound by eternal covenants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W989ZgIaD3g).
1. [Discussion of the General Conference talk "Whatsoever he saith unto you, Do it."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaqRgMqvie8)
1. Examples and discussion of [milieu control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7HFSClydA0).
1. Exert general influence on behavior, information, thought, and environment (see [The BITE Model and Mormon Control](http://www.rationalrevelation.com/library/bite.html))
1. The importance of keeping the commandments is repeatedly emphasized in Latter-day Saint culture, and there is an [extensive list of do's and do not's](http://recoveringagency.com/articles/list-of-lds-commandments/) that members are expected to always be striving to achieve.  Members fall short in various ways and hence are often made to feel [perpetually inadequate](http://recoveringagency.com/articles/the-methods-of-thought-reform/demand-for-purity-perpetual-inadequacy/)

The book by Luna Lindsey, [Recovering Agency: Lifting the Veil of Mormon Mind Control](http://recoveringagency.com/), gives additional examples and perspective on the topic.  "Thinker of Thoughts" has produced many videos (some with Luna Linsey) exploring aspects of thought-reform and undue influence within the LDS Church (for example, [parallel concepts with scientology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLevx2DAlF-YBazPpn-110Ft0AsC01MrkY) and [undue influence in Oct 2015 General Conference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLevx2DAlF-YDCOcCRWFWDmZesrQe5K0zJ)).  Finally, [Fix your faith crisis with this one weird trick!](http://thoughtsonthingsandstuff.com/fix-your-faith-crisis-with-this-one-weird-trick/) offers perspective on how a practitioner of any religion may ensure they are not succumbing to thought-reform.

## Different mindsets

One may view the primary mindsets of the LDS Church as [the corporate, the individual growth, and the totalistic](https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/three-fold-nature-lds-church-corporate-totalistic-individual-growth/).  In particular, the individual growth and totalistic mindsets are in some [tension with one another](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/raw/efb593d5c2ee37bc3e4638976331668a33367131/documents/threefold-nature-of-the-church/examples-of-tension-between-individual-growth-and-totalistic-mindsets.pdf).  This means that much of the strong, retentive socialization documented above is softened by the individual growth mindset, and sometimes the corporate mindset.

[^insufficientjustification]: The practice of bearing a testimony to find it may take advantage of the phenomenon of "insufficient justification". [From the 1959 study](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/) on insufficient justification: "If a person is induced to do or say something which is contrary to his private opinion, there will be a tendency for him to change his opinion so as to bring it into correspondence with what he has done or said." ([video which details the experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkJc6c3nKMw) and more on [insufficient justification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufficient_justification))

[^avoid_early_release_tactics]: Twenty-one methods and gates a Mission President may employ before allowing a missionary to return home (h/t reddit user [curious_mormon](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2qlcqk/21_the_number_of_methods_and_gates_a_mission/)) from the [2006 Missionary Handbook](https://archive.org/details/MissionPresidentsHandbook2006):

    > Some missionaries suffer from homesickness or discouragement. Others suffer from a lack of confidence. Some may have difficulty leaving the cares of the world behind. Such missionaries might ask to go home. These concerns are generally most acute during the first 90 days of a missionary's service.

    > You can identify and resolve many of these concerns during your initial interviews with missionaries. [1] Explain that such feelings are common in the early weeks, especially on weekends or holidays, and may recur at other times. Help them understand how to combat negative feelings, and make sure they know that you are always ready to give encouragement and counsel.

    > If a missionary is determined to return home, seek counsel from the Area Presidency and discuss the situation with your Missionary Department In-Field Services representative. To help a struggling missionary, [2]you may invite him or her to visit the mission home, or [3]you may arrange for a visit to the home of a priesthood leader in the area where the missionary is serving. The atmosphere there, plus [4]a personal interview and [5]a priesthood blessing, often can re- store sagging spirits. [6]Your wife can often have an influence in strengthening a missionary.

    > [7]Help the missionary understand that deciding to return home is a very serious matter but that the final decision is his or hers.

    > Ask the missionary to talk with [8]his or her parents, [9]bishop, or [10]stake president. You should learn what they say so that you can build on it. [11]If the home priesthood leaders know that the family wants the missionary to continue serving, make sure the missionary calls home. Even if the parents were not originally in favor of the mission, they may want their missionary to finish what he or she has started. Parents or priesthood leaders may recommend other people who can help, [12]such as a friend (including a girlfriend if she will be supportive), [13]a youth leader, a [14]seminary teacher, or a [15]returned missionary.

    > [16]Some struggling missionaries respond well to a "test period." You might give a missionary [17]an assignment suited to his or her needs. Then you could say, "Try it for three months. If you feel the same way, we'll call the Area Presidency (or Church headquarters) about your request." [18]You might also ask the missionary to stay at least until the next transfer so that the work will not be disrupted and his or her companion will not need to be transferred.

    > [19]Explain that if the missionary returns home at his or her own insistence, the missionary and the family are to reimburse the Church for the cost of the return trip home.
If after [20]counseling with the Area Presidency, all efforts fail and a missionary insists on going home, [21]ask your Missionary Department In-Field Services representative for further instructions. You should not feel personally responsible when a missionary goes home early after you have done all you can.

[^passports]: Passports are held in the mission home of many missions.  This was the practice in my mission, and has [been reported by many others](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2qlcqk/21_the_number_of_methods_and_gates_a_mission/).

[^invasive_interviews]: Worthiness interviews may vary depending on the leader, but some of them appear to be more invasive than others:

    * Bishops may ask very probing questions about sexuality, particularly to those about to serve a mission ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6aotgt/list_of_questions_a_bishop_asks_premissionaries/))
    * Bishops may ask children as young as 8 years old if they touch themselves ([example](https://bishopsinterview.blogspot.com/?view=classic&m=1), [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdw10y8ABM&t=3s)).
    * Some leaders ask youth and adults about their orgasms and sexual positions as they probe regarding masturbation and past sexual transgressions. [testimonials](https://invisiblescubit.wordpress.com/2017/07/04/did-you-orgasm/)
    * A leader, at their discretion, _may_ ask an individual to reconfess _all_ past sins to whatever previous point in time they deem relevant ([for example](https://brettsbigbadblog.blogspot.com/2017/06/lds-temple-cancellation-and-clearance.html), "'all transgressions' committed since your first sealing, even those that have already been resolved by church authorities")
    * Missionaries frequently confess and reconfess all their sins in an effort to become worthy ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2fdcgt/one_of_the_worst_aspects_of_mormon_culture_imo/))
    * Bishops may use social media to find evidence of indiscretion ([example](https://github.com/faenrandir/a_careful_examination/blob/dd4835cb764c1bc66327645831172705a472684e/documents/threefold-nature-of-the-church/supporting_material/invasive_interviews.md))
