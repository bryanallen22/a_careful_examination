It is common for individuals to invoke the BITE model and other cultic research, showing how the LDS Church fits many (but not necessarily all) of those criteria, and then wondering if the LDS Church ought to be categorized as "a cult" ([for example](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/g1janh/lets_discuss_cults_and_the_bite_model/). These kinds of arguments are foundationally suspect because the legitimacy of the entire cult research movement as an academic enterprise is somewhat suspect.  Most researchers of the psychology and sociology of religion today would not consider the exercise of classifying a group as a "cult" particularly valid or helpful.

Some background on the cultic research movement is helpful.  There was a crescendo of academic and intellectual thought from the 60s and on into the 1980s thinking about what constituted a cult and discussing cultic behavior.  This included the work of Robert J. Lifton, Margaret Singer, John G. Clark, Jr., and Stanley H. Cath (e.g., as discussed in [this New York Times article](https://www.culteducation.com/brainwashing/3256-the-psychology-of-the-cult-experiences.html) from 1982).

All of this research and focus culminated in the creation of the DIMPAC report (with the well-respected Margaret Singer at the helm) in 1986.  BUT, in 1987 the APA Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) **rejected** the DIMPAC report (See [the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APA_Task_Force_on_Deceptive_and_Indirect_Methods_of_Persuasion_and_Control) for a summary).

At that point, those who still wanted to pursue study in the vein of the DIMPAC report rallied together and created their own journals,  scientific societies, and conferences, and they become the counter-cult movement.  Hassan fits within this movement, as does Michael Langone, who summarizes the history of this split [here](https://www.icsahome.com/articles/the-two-camps-of-cultic-studies-langone).

Everyone else studying psychology and sociology seems to have *dropped* counter-cult studies, and counter-cult studies have never regained scientific credibility on any large scale. There are a few peripheral counter-cult studies that have made it into respectable journals, but they are not mainstream counter-cult approaches.  Most psychologists of religion refer to "cults" as "new religious movements" and they are not even *trying* to classify or study cults in the same manner as the counter-cultists.  They just see new religious movements as one manifestation of a common human experience, with some NRMs being more harmful or totalistic than others.

Most psychology of religion professors today will use something like "social learning" to discuss behavior in new religious movements (and maybe the LDS Church is no longer even an NRM since it is not so new anymore).  We can still discuss things like indoctrination, levels of totalism, and the *kinds* of socialization that happen in the LDS Church, but it has little to do with classifying the institution as a "cult" or the BITE model.[^my_experience]

I discuss ways in which the LDS Church culture and programs act to retain members using social learning as the underlying paradigm:[^academic_validation]

[LDS Indoctrination and Retentive Socialization](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/lds-indoctrination-and-retentive-socialization/)

Many Latter-day Saints have read that document and responded with something like "so what," but that only underscores the validity of this approach: An academic characterization of a religious movement should ring true to the lived experience of its adherents and seek to be as objective as possible regarding various helps and harms that a person might experience within the religion.

To conclude, there *are* interesting ways that totalism and retentive socialization happen in the LDS Church, but that is not *necessarily* a bad thing because *everyone* is being socialized in so many different ways as parts of so many different groups in their life.  We should be able to acknowledge that some of it is harmful and some of it is helpful.


[^my_experience]: I learned all of that by hard experience.  After spending close to a year writing up a critique of the LDS Church using Robert J. Lifton's model of ideological totalism, I had these kinds of discussions with some well-informed members of this forum and psychology of religion professors (by email).  Ultimately, I found their criticisms valid, and I mostly ditched my original analysis and decided to use a "social learning" model.  Here's what I ended up with:
[^academic_validation]: My approach was guided by discussion with Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi (the academic primarily responsible for rejecting the DIMPAC report).  A professor of psychology (formerly at Brigahm Young University) who studied the psychology of religion has read the final document and expressed that my approach is valid and consistent with current academic approaches.
