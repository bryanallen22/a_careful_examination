Submitted the following to the Church History Library:

> Please state your question

What is the complete list of items, resources, and books held by the Church in its vault?  What is the complete list of items, resources, and books not publicly accessible or (to this point) not known to exist by the general public?
 
If that list cannot be released (for some reason or other), can you provide me with an estimate of the number of books or journals that are currently being held but which are not publicly accessible or currently unknown by the general public?
 
The Church has recently been pushing for increased transparency, so it seems like this kind of question may now be asked with some hope that it may be answered.
 
Thank you!

Some googling on the topic, but nothing authoritative could be found :(
