# Outline of my beliefs

Here is a basic summary of my beliefs in my own words.  My beliefs can be subdivided into three categories: the importance of good models, agency and morality, and living well.

## The Importance of Good Models

1. I believe that the universe operates under certain principles that appear to be inviolable.
2. I believe that the more accurately our internal model of reality aligns with reality, the greater our ability to comprehend and either adeptly control or peacefully accept the world around us.  I believe that those who care about being moral beings should also care about the accuracy of their models of reality.
3. I believe that scientific investigation is the most powerful method we have available to us for discerning what *is* (although it is not able to directly answer questions of what *should* be).
4. I believe that our feelings are culturally and biologically conditioned and are strongly biased to our own self-interest, hence our feelings sometimes misrepresent reality to us and should always be checked by rational thought (specifically, tests of generalizability).
5. I believe that nihilistic (nihilism: we will die so nothing matters), hedonistic (hedonism: the only thing that matters is pleasure and pain), and reductionistic (reductionism: we are mere bags of molecules hence morality does not really exist) philosophies ignore important data about our existence; hence, I am *not* a nihilist, I am *not* a hedonist, and I am *not* a reductionist.
6. I seek and welcome additional data and criticism of my beliefs so that they can be refined and serve me and those around me better.  Good beliefs (i.e., models of reality) should be able to withstand scrutiny.

If my beliefs are incorrect or based on insufficient or faulty data, please do not hesitate to correct me or offer me your perspective.

## Agency and Morality

1. I believe that we are largely free-agents---we control the contours of our destiny via the decisions we make.
2. I believe that moral agents (all beings with certain properties of self-reflection, awareness, and agency) are duty bound to act according to basic moral principles in their relationships with other conscious life.
3. I believe that any time beings with properties of a moral agent exist, then morality exists also (i.e., if a silicon based life-form had all the properties of humans but had evolved or was created independently of biological life, then moral principles would apply equally to them).
4. I believe that our ethical duty to other living entities is in some way proportional to the extent that they are conscious or have potential for consciousness (i.e., it is unethical to torture monkeys or dolphins, but it is not unethical to eat bacteria just for fun since they undoubtedly are not conscious and have no capacity for consciousness).
5. I believe the core moral principles include: caring, fairness, liberty, and loyalty.
6. I believe that acting morally tends to brings us and those around us happiness.  However, even if acting morally did not generate feelings of content, I believe we would still have a rational obligation to act morally.

If my actions are immoral or fail to align with the highest standards of morality, please do not hesitate to offer me correction or your perspective.

## Living Well

1. I believe that life is worth living for its own sake.
2. I believe that our minds are capable of integrating thoughts, ideas, and information in ways we don't fully comprehend conciously, and hence meditation, self-reflection, and intuition are all valuable tools available to us in acting wisely and living well.
3. I believe that expressions of love (in word and deed) bring us (those giving and receiving) happiness and joy.  Even if these acts did not generate a biological reaction in us, I believe they would still be satisfying and worthwhile to beings capable of rational self-reflection.
4. I believe that individuals in positions of power have a duty to defend weaker individuals insofar as they are able and to wield that power in fair and responsible ways.
5. I believe that when we make mistakes that we ought to communicate our regret, make amends insofar as is possible, and alter our behavior in order to avoid inflicting harm on others (or avoid shirking our duty) in the future.

If I am living poorly or failing to live well, please do not hesitate to share your perspective with me of how to live a good life.

I share many basic beliefs with the conscientious, moral citizens of our world.

3. Self-responsibility --- "There is no one coming to our rescue, individually or collectively; no one is going to save us."
4. Self-assertiveness --- "unleashing our personality, intellectual abilities, talents, etc., whether other people, including family members and friends, like it or not"
5. Living purposefully --- "we have the right to establish goals for ourselves based on what we think and feel is right and good"
6. Personal integrity --- "It takes courage to act with integrity to the truth, particularly one's inner truth that others may dislike, negatively judge, and even condemn."

## Beliefs expressed parallel to the Articles of Faith

My beliefs can be expressed in similar form to the Articles of Faith:

# Belief in the Spiritual

Although I consider the summary at the top of this document largely a complete statement of my beliefs, friends often want to know where I stand regarding particular core LDS beliefs.

I summarize my belief relative to core LDS beliefs below.  I view these as positive, life and value affirming beliefs---this explication is not intended to be an attack on LDS belief (which I generally respect) but rather as a sincere description of my beliefs relative to core LDS beliefs.  Again, please see the "Basic Summary" at the beginning of this document for a long list of those beliefs that I may share to a significant degree with my LDS friends and family.  Please do not feel obligated to read on if a dicussion of my beliefs in contrast with core LDS beliefs is upsetting.

1. I hope that a benevolent, all-knowning, all-powerful God exists and that we will continue to exist forever.  The marvel of the known universe and the complexity and beauty of earth and human life provide an indirect basis for this hope.
1. I believe we are biologically related to all living organisms on this earth.
1. I believe that what LDS culture considers 'spirit' or 'a Spirit' is likely a person's mind or conciousness.
1. I believe that my nearly 40 years of consistent, sincere prayer represent an internal dialog and was not likely communication with a being other than myself.  As far as I am able to distinguish, there is no difference between the insight and communication I have when I am thinking aloud or thinking deeply to myself than when I was praying intently, and this internal dialog has not changed since I resigned from the Church or experienced a faith transition.  I believe that admitting to myself that I am likely just talking to myself when I pray is morally sound and acting in humility.
1. I believe that the feelings of peace and joy in my heart should be cultivated.  The feelings of peace and joy that I experience on a daily basis have not changed significantly since before and after my resignation or faith transition.  Hence, at least for myself, I believe that my access to feelings of peace and joy are not modulated by ordinances administered by the Church but rather by my actions and mindfulness.  I believe it is morally sound and acting in humility to admit that my feelings of peace and joy are likely self-generated (but generally when my actions and thoughts are aligned with moral principles).
1. I believe that most of those who express their spiritual feelings do so in sincerity.  Hence, given the [contradictory beliefs of those who believe in spiritual truth](https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/testimony-spiritual-experiences-truth-careful-examination/), I am left believing that spiritual feelings are inadequate tools to illuminate spiritual truth with any precision.  I believe that skepticism in the ability of spiritual feelings to accurately communicate objective reality is morally sound and acting in humility.
1. I believe that honestly admitting the bounds of my knowledge and experience is morally sound and acting in humility.  I believe it is morally questionable for a person to lead others to believe that they have more knowledge than they possess and that we have a duty to try to distinguish between our feelings and objective reality.
1. I do not have enough information to state with any confidence whether or not God exists nor exactly what kinds of attributes he/she/it possesses (and that extends to all the thousands of deities that have been worshipped across time [Poseidon, Bhagavathi, Aganju, etc]).  I believe that through my feelings alone I have no way to distinguish between a God who loves us deeply and, say, an evil God who finds entertainment in building up our hopes only to make us suffer for all eternity.  I believe it is morally sound to admit that I don't have any first-hand knowledge of God or his attributes and to be skeptical of contradictory reports of his being by those claiming first-hand experience.  If God is all-knowing, then God also knows that I am a moral person of love, honesty, truth, and integrity.  I have asked in sincerity for God to visit with me many times---God is free to visit or communicate with me at any time.  Until that time, my sense of morality does not allow me to express knowledge of God beyond my experience.
1. I believe that if there is a God that God [does not likely intervene in a detectable or measurable way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_on_intercessory_prayer) in human affairs.  I believe that freely expressing the belief that God does not appear to intervene (upon unbiased investigation) is morally sound and acting in humility.
1. I believe that I do not have enough information to make any certain claims about Jesus Christ, his atonement, or his resurrection.  Again, I believe that refraining from making statements of knowledge that go beyond my experience is morally sound and acting in humility.
1. I believe there are many teachings and examples from Jesus's life that have value in explaining or demonstrating moral principles (I'm aware of [C.S. Lewis's trilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis%27s_trilemma) but reject it). I also believe there is much to learn from other individuals of great moral character (e.g., Socrates, Jorge Bergoglio [Pope Francis], many past and present leaders of the LDS Church, John Adams, Abraham Lincoln, Laozi [author of the Tao Te Ching], [Ip Man](https://chinesemartialstudies.com/2013/12/08/the-wing-chun-rules-of-conduct-rediscovering-ip-mans-original-statement-on-the-philosophy-of-the-martial-arts/), Florence Nightingale, Rosa Parks, Emmeline Pankhurst, and, of course, my wife, parents, siblings, in-laws, and ancestors, just to name a few).
