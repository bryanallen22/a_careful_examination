I find spiritual insight and inspiration in the following (even though I also tend to disagree with aspects of each):

* [The Bible and LDS scripture](https://www.lds.org/scriptures?lang=eng)
* Teachings of many LDS leaders (e.g., General Conference and BYU speeches)
* The works of C.S. Lewis
* Works by Stephen Covey and similar self-help and management books
* Ideas of [Brene Brown](http://brenebrown.com/)
* [Tao Te Ching](http://www.taoism.net/ttc/complete.htm)
* [The Triple Path](http://triplepath.org/)
* [The Socratic dialogues](http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plato/)
* [Kantian ethics](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/kant1785.pdf)
* [Utilitarianism](http://www.utilitarianism.com/mill1.htm)
* Some of [Tolstoy's religious writings](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/06/03/tolstoy-confession/)
* [The Church of Reality](http://www.churchofreality.org/wisdom/welcome_home/)
* [The Church of Spiritual Humanism](http://www.spiritualhumanism.org/practices.php)
* [Humanism](http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/what_is_humanism)
* Some of the thoughts of secular humanists like [Bart Campolo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3JIdCruIpo)
* Modern moral philosophy (e.g., [What is moral progress?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQr6fKlsf_c), [Being Good and Doing Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxStuUxaZxQ), [The Virtues of Cold Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIK2vlE6UIk)).
* Modern [epistemology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f28AAkLm9ZA) as it relates to values.
