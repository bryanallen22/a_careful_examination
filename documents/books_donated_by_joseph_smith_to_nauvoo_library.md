In [The Complete Record of the Nauvoo Library and Literary Institute](https://ensignpeakfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/The-Complete-Record-of-the-Nauvoo-Library-and-Literary-Institute.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3GzV1T-sx-_luy2HcA8j3iasy0aBlURHeh_66vOEamijfX1qWtLJ0q_uQ)   (Mormon Historical Studies 10:1, 2009: pgs 180–204) Christopher C. Jones transcribes the entire record of the Nauvoo Library and Literary Institute. It includes a ledger of books donated and payment received and includes a donation of 38 works by Joseph Smith. The list of those 38 books is reproduced below, along with links to the work online where available.

*The linked work is **my best guess** at the identity of the book, but there's some intrinsic uncertainty involved in trying to identify the book being referred to (or the edition). Notes are in brackets. Supplying links to the book/imprint is a work in progress.*
