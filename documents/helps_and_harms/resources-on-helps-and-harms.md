## Both helps and harms

*To my knowledge, these were both compiled by former/questioning members, so
they may still be biased, but some effort was made to catalog both helps and
harms.*

* [Helps and harms]({{ "/documents/helps_and_harms/Helps_and_Harms.pdf" | relative_url }}) (one page summary)
* [The Pros and Cons of Mormonism](https://web.archive.org/web/20190428215610/http://prosandconsofmormonism.com/) (extensive analysis)

## Harms

* [Discussion of harms to minority groups](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/96iei9/im_mormon_and_was_just_curious_as_to_why_people/e41b5g8/) (comment by bwv549)
* [Discussion of harms to faithful adherents](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/96st4p/a_semicomprehensive_list_of_harms_and_negative/) (post by fuzzy_thoughts)

* [How Mormonism Harms People](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/vizdxc/how_mormonism_harms_people_my_collection_of/) (a collection of bookmarks by positivelyexmormon)

## Helps

* The first section of [Latter-day Hope](http://latterdayhope.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/latter-day-hope.pdf) presents arguments of benefits to members or society deriving from the Church.
