> The LDS church has always been behind the times on the social issues.

> The church thought polygamy was right until it was wrong.

> The church thought resisting the US federal government’s authority was right until it was wrong.

> The church thought resisting the civil rights movement was right until it was wrong.

> The church thought fighting feminism was right until it was wrong. [well, it’s working on it]

> The church thinks fighting marriage equality is right, and it’s going to turn out to be wrong.

> And how do I trust my relationship to an in-group that has failed that consistently on the big moral questions of the day …in fact they legalized slavery in the Utah territory because, you know, why not?
