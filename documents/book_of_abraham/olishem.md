John Gee discusses the potential discovery of Olishem [here](https://publications.mi.byu.edu/publications/jbms/22/2/9Gee_Olishem%20Discovered.pdf).

### Counterpoint

Problems with this potential match discussed at [RFM](https://www.exmormon.org/phorum/read.php?2,513409):

1. The name is not an exact match.  Loose matches are far more likely to occur by random chance than exact matches.
2. The location isn't a great fit relative to the ancient city-state of Ur.
3. A possible scenario for how Joseph Smith could have derived the name from his study of the Hebrew language is advanced:

    > Joseph Smith was learning Hebrew at the time he was producing the Book of Abraham, and obviously using that knowledge in his text ("Kokaubeam" really is Hebrew for "stars"). He likely invented the name from Hebrew 'olah' ("burnt sacrifice" or "evil") and 'shem' ("name"): "Olishem" is Smith's made-up Hebrew word for "name of a place for evil sacrifice."

### Discussion on Geography

The story where the plains of Olishem appear seems to be taking place in or by Ur (Potiphar's Hill):

> Abraham 1:10 - Even the thank-offering of a child did the apriest of Pharaoh offer upon the altar which stood by the hill called Potiphar’s Hill, at the head of the plain of Olishem.

It seems remarkable (but not necessarily impossible) that the plain would be named after a city 745 miles away. 

Gee states "Oylum Höyük is the largest site in the Kilis plain and clearly dominated the whole plain in the Middle Bronze Age."  But in another line, Gee may be acknowledging the geographical tension:

> Ur should be in the same plain and about five to twenty miles from Olishem.

However, the ancient city-state of Ur was located 745 miles away from Oylum Höyük.  Is Gee proposing that Abraham's Ur is actually much closer to Olishem?  Either way, some tension in this putative location seems to exist with the standard location of Ur.
