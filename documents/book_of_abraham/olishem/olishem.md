The idea that Olishem is evidence for the Book of Abraham (BoA) was recently mentioned [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/8oyb98/i_need_some_clarification/e07y53w/) and this comment points to a chapter from [No Weapon Shall Prosper: New Light on Sensitive Issues](https://rsc.byu.edu/award-winning/no-weapon-shall-prosper-new-light-sensitive-issues) called [Egyptian Papyri and the Book of Abraham: A Faithful, Egyptological Point of View](https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/no-weapon-shall-prosper/egyptian-papyri-and-book-abraham-faithful-egyptological-point-view).

The potential Olishem connection is discussed in depth by John Gee [here](https://publications.mi.byu.edu/publications/jbms/22/2/9Gee_Olishem%20Discovered.pdf).

### Counterpoint

Problems with this potential match have been discussed at [RFM](https://www.exmormon.org/phorum/read.php?2,513409):

1. The name is close, but is not really an exact match (compare "Ulišu" or "Ulishu" with "Olishem").  Loose matches are far more likely to occur by random chance than exact matches.
2. The location isn't a good fit relative to the ancient city-state of Ur (although, note that LDS scholars postulate that the Ur identified by most scholars was not the Ur discussed in the BoA, which they claim was [somewhere not far to the east of Haran](https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/pearl-great-price-revelations-god/where-was-ur-chaldees)).
3. A possible scenario for how Joseph Smith could have derived the name from his study of the Hebrew language is advanced:

    > Joseph Smith was learning Hebrew at the time he was producing the Book of Abraham, and obviously using that knowledge in his text ("Kokaubeam" really is Hebrew for "stars"). He likely invented the name from Hebrew 'olah' ("burnt sacrifice" or "evil") and 'shem' ("name"): "Olishem" is Smith's made-up Hebrew word for "name of a place for evil sacrifice."

### Relocating Ur

The story where the plains of Olishem appear seems to be taking place in or by Ur (Abraham 1:10, 20):

> Even the thank-offering of a child did the apriest of Pharaoh offer upon the altar which stood by the hill called Potiphar’s Hill, at the head of the plain of Olishem.

> Behold, Potiphar’s Hill was in the land of Ur, of Chaldea ...

Based primarily on internal evidence from the BoA, LDS scholars abandon the traditional location of Ur [for one much closer to Haran](https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/pearl-great-price-revelations-god/where-was-ur-chaldees).  

This explains Gee's discussion of the location of Ur:

> Ur should be in the same plain and about five to twenty miles from Olishem.

And

> If indeed tablets from Hittite from the site identify it as Ullis, the it is probably the Ulisum that Naram-Sin attacked and is a likely candidate for Olishem. If Oylum Höyük is Olishem, **the Ur of the Chaldees should be one of the dozens of Middle Bronze II sites in the Kilis plain**. We await further discoveries and publications. At present, given the many uncertainties, we can regard this identification as promising but not proven.

So, the location of Olishem is internally consistent but only if we abandon the traditional location for Ur (which there may be some good reasons to do) in favor of some unknown location in the Kilis plain.

It is worth noting that if we assume that Ur is the Ur much farther to the Southeast (the Ur of current scholarly concensus), then the support for the BoA is significantly weakened since Oylum Höyük is 745 miles away from the consensus Ur.

### Abraham as a historical figure

All of the above discussion assumes that Abraham was an actual historical figure, which most scholars today doubt.  To begin with:

> we have no extrabiblical information about prominent biblical figures such as Abraham and Moses, or even David and Solomon. [source](https://books.google.com/books?id=hd28MdGNyTYC&q=Abraham#v=snippet&q=Abraham&f=false)

Textual analysis of the Abraham story itself shows evidence of later composition (see [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=7cdy67ZvzdkC&q=Abraham#v=snippet&q=Abraham&f=false) and also fits a needed narrative of some later Israelites:

> A common hypothesis among scholars is that it [the Abraham story] was composed in the early Persian period (late 6th century BCE) as a result of tensions between Jewish landowners who had stayed in Judah during the Babylonian captivity and traced their right to the land through their "father Abraham", and the returning exiles who based their counter-claim on Moses and the Exodus tradition.  (from [Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham) in Wikipedia)

Of course, for a believing member the existence of the Book of Abraham _is_ evidence for a literal Abraham.  Perhaps God facilitated its translation in order to buttress wavering faith in the historicity of Abraham?  Needless to say, the skepticism of scholars in a historical Abraham weighs at least somewhat against the legitimacy of the BoA in total---if we grant that findings for the historical Abraham would increase our confidence that the BoA is a legitimate record then evidence and arguments against the historical Abraham ought to weaken our confidence in the BoA.

### Other Possible Sources

A map located in Allegheny College (in Pennsylvania) a few hundred miles from
Joseph Smith, which [also contains "Nehem"]() in its approximate location also
[contains the words 'Barrai-al Sham']() right where the plains of Olishem would be
located.  Next to the name is written: "In this Desert are found the Ruins of
several ancient Cities".  Not far below is written the text "Beled Shemer".
Someone seeing this map could easily notice the last part of Barrai-al Sham
("al Sham") and convolute it with the "Shem" from Shemer right below to form
"Olishem".

Another old map of the Arabian Peninsula, "Accuratissima et Maxima Totius Turcici Imperii Tabula", [has the word "Olim"]() right in the middle of the top part of the peninsula where we'd expect the plains of Olishem to be located.  Adjacent to the word "Olim" is written "Meschel Ocem" which could have easily provided the 'sh' sound for "Olishem."
