[^mormonthink]: www.mormonthink.com is a vast resource for presenting and discussing LDS truth-claims.  [The site states](http://www.mormonthink.com/) that they are "neither an anti-Mormon website nor an LDS apologist website", but the discussion and tone _is_ overwhelmingly critical, lest the reader be miseld by this disclaimer.  Regardless, it is a highly _useful_ resource as long as the site's bias is clearly appreciated.
