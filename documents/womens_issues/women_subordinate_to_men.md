The temple makes it very clear that women are separated from God and can only access that power through men.  [As detailed here](http://exmormon.org/phorum/read.php?2,1305696,1305696,quote=1):

* Adam helps make the earth, Eve does not.
* Adam is made directly by Christ, Eve is made through a piece of Adam.
* Adam is named directly by God, Eve is named by Adam. Eve is given to Adam, Adam is not given to Eve.
* Adam is specifically by name given the Garden of Eden, Eve is not.
* Adam covenants directly to obey God. Eve covenants to obey her husband.
* Adam is ordained to be a King and Priest to God, Eve is only ordained to be a Queen and Priestess to her husband.
* In the prayer circle when God’s presence is called into the room, Eve must veil her face as she cannot have direct access to God’s power. Her connection to God is through the grip of the man next to her. The man has direct communion with God.
* When they are kicked out of the Garden, Adam builds an alter prays to God, Eve does not.
* When women die, their faces are veiled symbolizing their inability to have direct access to God’s presence. Instead, their husbands must bring them into God’s presence by knowing their secret temple name. The women do not know their husbands’ name as he does not need her to bring him through the veil.
* In the sealing, the wife gives herself to the husband. The husband simply receives the wife, he does not need to give himself.
* Yes, men must be married to get into the highest level of Celestial Kingdom but that is NOT because he lacks the full priesthood without her, but because the highest level of the Celestial Kingdom has eternal increase, so he needs a woman to create his children.

Over and over again the temple teaches that women should not have direct access to God's power and it is only through their relationship with men that they can have access to the Priesthood Power of God.
