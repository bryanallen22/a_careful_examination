# Subordination of women to men in the LDS Church

In many ways, women in the LDS Church are subordinate to men.  A few formal and informal examples follow.

### In the Temple

Women are subordinate to men in the temple in the following ways:

1. Adam helps make the earth; Eve does not.
2. Adam is made directly by Christ; Eve is made through a piece of Adam.
3. Adam is named directly by God; Eve is named by Adam.
4. Eve is given to Adam; Adam is not given to Eve.
5. Adam is given the Garden of Eden by name; Eve is not.
6. Adam covenants directly to obey God; Eve covenants to obey her husband.
7. Adam is ordained to be a King and Priest to God; Eve is ordained to be a Queen and Priestess to her husband.
8. In the prayer circle when God’s presence is called into the room, Eve must veil her face.  Men are granted direct communion with God, while the woman is granted access via her grip to the man next to her.
9. When they are kicked out of the Garden, Adam builds an alter and prays to God, while Eve does not.
10. Men know their wife's name, while women do not know their husband's name---women need men, but men do not need a woman to bring them through the veil in anticipation of their sealing.
11. When women die, their faces are veiled, symbolizing their inability to have direct access to God’s presence. Instead, their husbands must bring them into God’s presence by knowing their secret new name.
12. In the sealing, [only women give themselves to their husband](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-covenants-that-are-made-in-a-Mormon-temple) (men and women both receive one another).

### Don't talk too much

Elder Ballard [recently taught](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSWPrzICnlQ) in the Europe Area Sisters' Meeting:

> Let your voices be heard.  We cannot meet our destiny as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in preparing this world for the Second Coming of the Savior of the world without the support and the faith and the strength of the women of this church.  We need you; we need your voices.  They need to be heard. They need to be heard in your community, in your neighborhoods.  They need to be heard in your Ward Council or the Branch Council.  **But don't talk too much in those council meetings**---just straighten the Brethren out quickly and move the work on!  We're building the Kingdom of God!  We're preparing the world for the Second Coming of the Savior and the Redeemer of the World. (emphasis added)

### Measuring equality

Measurements of equality confirm that women are considered subordinates in the LDS Church.  Kate Kelly [articulated](http://www.dovesandserpents.org/wp/2013/10/equality-is-not-a-feeling/) the difference between feelings of equality and measurements of equality:

> I have heard from many women, ‘I see nothing wrong with the status quo. I feel equal.’ To them I say: ‘You can feel respected, supported and validated in the church, but equality can be measured. Equality is not a feeling. In our church men and women are not equal.

See [the Equality Archive](http://www.dovesandserpents.org/wp/category/columns/equality-is-not-feeling/) at Doves & Serpents for many specific examples.
