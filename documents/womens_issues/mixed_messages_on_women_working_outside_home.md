Women have received mixed messages over time about the relative importance/evil of working outside the home.

---

Brigham Young

> As I have often told my sisters in the Female Relief Societies, we have sisters here who, if they had the privilege of studying, would make just as good mathematicians or accountants as any man; and we think they ought to have the privilege to study these branches of knowledge that they may develop the powers with which they are endowed. We believe that women are useful not only to sweep houses, wash dishes, make beds, and raise babies, but that they should stand behind the counter, study law or physic [medicine], or become good book-keepers and be able to do the business in any counting house, and this to enlarge their sphere of usefulness for the benefit of society at large (DBY, 216–17).  (From [Teachings of Brigham Young lesson manual](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-brigham-young/chapter-19?lang=eng))

Spencer W. Kimball

> No career approaches in importance that of wife, homemaker, mother—cooking meals, washing dishes, making beds for one’s precious husband and children. (From [Eternal Marriage Student Manual](https://www.lds.org/manual/eternal-marriage-student-manual/mothers-employment-outside-the-home?lang=eng))

Ezra Taft Benson

> The Lord clearly defined the roles of mothers and fathers in providing for and rearing a righteous posterity. In the beginning, Adam--not Eve--was instructed to earn the bread by the sweat of his brow. Contrary to conventional wisdom, a mother's calling is in the home, not in the market place. (From [Fireside for Parents, Feb 22, 1987](https://scottwoodward.org/Talks/html/Benson,%20Ezra%20Taft/BensonET_ToTheMothersInZion.html))

Quentin L. Cook

> [W]e should all be careful not to be judgmental or assume that sisters are less valiant if the decision is made to work outside the home. We rarely understand or fully appreciate people’s circumstances.  (From [April 2011 General Conference](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/lds-women-are-incredible?lang=eng))
