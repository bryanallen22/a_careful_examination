### Introduction

### The scriptures predicted all of this

> the scriptures predicted all of this

* Most Bible scholars today believe there is abundant evidence from Biblical texts themselves that the early Christians expected Jesus to return in *their* lifetimes.  [Search AcademicBiblical for "second coming"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/search?q=second+coming&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) to see discussions.
* There is abundant evidence that the early LDS Church all believed [the second coming was going to happen in their lifetime](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/failed-second-coming-predictions-in-early-lds-church/).
* Patriarchs have been promising people they would "not taste of death" and "live to see the second coming" [since the Church began](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/6rctgu/if_your_patriarchal_blessing_indicates_you_will/).  So many of these people have [already died](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/etg6rw/second_coming/).

You can track earthquakes around the world (e.g., [here](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/), [here](https://earthquaketrack.com/recent), or [here](https://www.emsc-csem.org/Earthquake/world/M5/)).  [Same old, same old](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263105/development-of-the-number-of-earthquakes-worldwide-since-2000/).

Bill Gates predicted an outbreak like coronavirus [in 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Af6b_wyiwI) (and obviously he's not a scientist, so his prediction is coming from them).  His relatively vague prediction is *far more accurate* than anything the scriptures or modern prophets say.  Because [science works](https://rationalwiki.org/w/images/5/54/Science.jpg).

> the prophet is right

It was the official position of the Church (published in official literature) that you could [pray away your gay](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/lds-statements-on-cause-and-cure-for-homosexuality/).  The gay, atheist, liberal sex researchers figured it out *way* before the prophet.  Those are the people making accurate predictions about the world, it seems.

Also, compare something like [pubmed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=health) with the Word of Wisdom.  Science gives us so much more resolution and accuracy on topics of health and wellbeing than anything spoken over an LDS pulpit.
