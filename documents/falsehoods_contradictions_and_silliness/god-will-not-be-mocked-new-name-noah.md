The stories found in [1 Kings 18](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/18) (Priests of Baal), [Mosiah 27](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27) (Alma the Younger), and [Alma 30](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/30) (Korihor) all show or tell that when God's power and authority are put to the test, he follows through. Mike Norton has brought himself Alma the Younger and Korihor level status by [recording all the temple ceremonies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6udew9axmdM&list=PL4-6rXpMOwwfCNXDXYFlhLxZtgzAD_scY). If God will not be mocked and he has power and authority, why has Mike Norton not been stopped?
