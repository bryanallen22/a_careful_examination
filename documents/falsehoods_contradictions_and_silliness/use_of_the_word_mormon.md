> With increased conversations about Mormons taking place in New York City, the Church launched the “I’m a Mormon” campaign there this week. 

> “Our Church is known for our efforts to share our message,” said Elder Richard G. Hinckley, Executive Director of the Missionary Department.  “During the past several decades we’ve used media focusing primarily on what we believe.  This effort focuses more on who we are because of what we believe.”
