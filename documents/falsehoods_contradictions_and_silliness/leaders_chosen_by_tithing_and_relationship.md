1. "Highest tithe payers"

    Leonard Arrington noted in his diary, dated Aug 17, 1992, his frustration with the practice of the day:
    
    > Appointing the highest tithe payers to positions of leadership rather than the most capable or worthy. In choosing stake leaders, the General Authority comes with a list of the 15 or 20 highest tithe payers and starts down the list to choose a stake president and high council.

2. Relationship to current leadership

The data suggest that one's [relationship with an existing general authority](https://www.mormonmatters.org/nepotism-in-the-church/) seems to be a major factor in leadership callings.
