## Introduction

In Elder Ballard's [2017 YSA Face to Face](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/face-to-face/oaks-ballard?lang=eng) he stated:

> We’re as transparent as we know how to be in telling the truth.

and that they as Church leaders had

> never tried to hide anything from anybody

In a [2018 Face to Face with Elder Cook](https://www.thechurchnews.com/leaders-and-ministry/2018-09-10/what-elder-cook-and-historians-said-about-polygamy-seer-stones-and-church-transparency-during-nauvoo-face-to-face-8671), Dr. Kate Holbrook added:

> The Church did not hide information from me, but the historical information was not emphasized to me

At a broad-stroke level, perhaps these statements by Elder Ballard and Dr. Holbrook are good characterizations.  I am not aware of that many clear-cut examples of where things were hidden from the body of the Church.  I am also inclined to give Church leadership the benefit of the doubt regarding their *motivation*, especially where we don't have documentation indicating their motivation.  Intentional dishonesty can be very difficult to demonstrate in the historical record.[^dishonesty]

With that said, I think there are a few good examples of where the Church (or its representatives) appear to have failed to inform members or investigators of things they perhaps should have (i.e., they knew about things that are relevant to LDS truth-claims and they failed to make those readily available or transparent) or misrepresented the data.  I am hesitant to label these "hiding." *Hiding* can be seen as implying motivation and/or dishonesty.  I would rather just concede at the the outset that LDS leadership probably genuinely view their own actions as honest and honorable.  For instance, they might personally classify all of their actions as: 1) an honest mistake or ignorance 2) appropriate, 3) necessary to protect the innocent, 4) defending the faith, or 5) refusing to "cast pearls before swine."

Still, I believe that agency is fundamentally precious and that a person cannot act with a full measure of agency unless the facts of the matter are accessible to them.  From that angle, then, I am less concerned with what the motivation of LDS leadership was when choosing whether to make information accessible than that information was not readily avaiable or perhaps misrepresented.  When leaders or institutions are transparent with the relevant data, then that allows others to fully exercise their agency, and I think we all applaud that.  When leaders or institutions fail to make relevant information accessible (whatever their reasons, even if noble) then this is concerning since it can hinder a person in exercising their agency and selecting the best model among competing models.[^models]

## Examples of transparency failures

These are some modern examples[^modern] where LDS leadership or the institution appear to have failed to provide, or hindered the availability of, information that members or investigators arguably should have access to.

* **1922**&nbsp; Failure to publicize issues with Book of Mormon historicity.

    Significant issues with Book of Mormon historicity were [made known to all of the LDS leadership in 1922](https://scholarworks.unr.edu/handle/11714/6712).[^montez]  B.H. Roberts wrote up these issues in [a series of long essays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_of_the_Book_of_Mormon).  LDS leadership could have published or made these studies more widely available.

* **~1930s--1963**&nbsp; Knowledge of the 1832 First Vision account was suppressed

    [The 1832 First Vision account was suppressed between 11 and ~30 years](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/1832-first-vision-account-suppressed/).

* **~1970-1993**&nbsp; Arrington describes efforts to prevent 'real' history from being published

    The recent [release of Leonard Arrington's journals](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/05/09/new-collection-of-leonard-arringtons-vast-journals-shows-battles-the-mormon-historian-had-with-lds-leaders-over-telling-the-truth-about-the-churchs-past/) (~2,700 pages) documents the "cancellation or censorship of work produced by Arrington and his stable of historians and writers."

    Arrington documented how sources that had once been available to Church historians vanished when he had been transferred to BYU.  [Dobay summarizes](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V27N01_103.pdf):

    > Although Arrington gamely accepted [the] explanation for this relocation as an effort to enhance historical study, many omens pointed to other motives for moving scholars away from the archives in Salt Lake City. Valuable journals and letters of such nineteenth-century Mormons as William C. Clayton, John Taylor, George Q. Cannon, and Francis M. Lyman, selectively available in the 1970s, disappeared from scrutiny. (see footnote 17)

    Arrington also discussed the different views of LDS leadership on writing LDS history (in his book The Writing of Mormon History, as represented to me by Anthony D. Miller):

    > I was shaken by the way in which these brethren [Benson and Petersen] had their way; by the failure of anyone to defend the book, to speak up for it, to explain why we felt it was a good book. The entire episode convinced me that there are some Brethren, including the two persons next in line to be president of the Church and president of the Quorum of Twelve, who would not approve of any of our work ... We have to reckon with the distinct possibility that, upon President Kimball’s death, these brethren, if they are still alive, will probably replace us and greatly diminish and alter the work of studying and writing about Church history. [pgs 290-291]

    > [Delbert] Stapley then relayed the sentiment of some within the Twelve that 'we should not put anything in any of our histories that reflects badly on the Church ... I replied that if our picture is entirely rosy nobody, even members of the Church, will have confidence in what we write because members of the Church know that there are warts and blemishes and unless we acknowledge some of these they will not have confidence that we are writing the whole truth and nothing but the truth.' His reply was again, we must leave the bad things out of our history. [pg 285]

    And from [his journal](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/05/09/new-collection-of-leonard-arringtons-vast-journals-shows-battles-the-mormon-historian-had-with-lds-leaders-over-telling-the-truth-about-the-churchs-past/): 

    > It is clear that President Benson will not stand for our ‘real’ history. And since he is next in line, and president of the Twelve, we are in a powerless position, and no one wishes to consider our own rationale,” Arrington wrote Sept. 6, 1976. “ ... The question for me is shall I retain the job ... and try to write history which will be approved by [the church’s] Correlation [Department] or shall I resign and continue to write ‘real history.’

    > Elders Benson and [Mark E. Petersen] … want glorious stories of the Restoration [of the gospel], unsullied by discussion of practical problems and controversial evidence. They want prophets without warts, revelation direct from high in pure vessels. The want faith-promoting stories and moral homilies. They feel strongly and will oppose all our books, written as we understand history.

    > ... some church officers do not want the church to promulgate historical truth. ... If they do not want historical truth, what do these officials want?  They favor the purveying of traditional truth, which is different from historical truth, scientific truth or philosophical truth.

    Arrington also viewed the September 6 excommunications as "blaming the messenger":

    > These excommunications are the worst examples of blaming the messenger for the message.  What a perversion of apostasy, to regard as apostates individuals who are … loyal and believing.

* **~1973**&nbsp; Publication of Lester Bush's research on the Priesthood Ban discouraged

    Lester Bush [described the attitude of LDS leadership and the difficulties in performing research](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23287744) for Mormonism's Negro Doctrine[^bush]:

    > In attempting to gain access to some materials in the Church Historian’s Office, I was required to meet with its head, ninety-two-year-old Apostle Joseph Fielding Smith.  His main points in our interview were that the work on blacks and the priesthood already had been done (i.e., his own work), and that the Church didn’t want every “Tom, Dick, or Harry” looking through its records. Naively—and armed with my temple recommend—I said I didn’t think I was any “Tom, Dick, or Harry.” He replied, with a smile, that they didn’t want any “Tom, Dick, or Bob” either.

    > ... an archival staff member explained that I couldn't look at a vast collection of documents then termed the Manuscript History of the Church but let me photocopy an annotated index to this collection, which included much substantive detail. ...

   He described in multiple letters Boyd K. Packer's disposition towards the public availability of difficult documents:

   > To a large extent, they were sorry the material [Bennion papers] was available—but this already had been verified for them by the Historical Dept., so that was not primarily directed at me. [Packer did, however, ask again who at BYU gave me the Bennion papers. I told him that my brother originally had come onto the Bennion papers while doing research at BYU. I was asked if my brother worked there at the time, which he didn’t, and the subject was again dropped. As part of this discussion I again mentioned that almost identical materials were available in the George Albert Smith Papers at the University of Utah. To this Packer responded with visible disdain that this was not the result of a charitable interest in scholarship on the part of the Smith family, but rather they had sold (as in, “their birthright”) these sensitive materials to the university.] My notes apparently were not evaluated for substantive questions, but rather from the perspective of what material had gotten out, and how.

    And:

    > ... When I pressed for some specifics as to problems with my paper, they explained that the material I had included on President Joseph F. Smith showed him reversing his opinion on a crucial point regarding Elijah Abel, an early black priesthood holder. This information, they said, could undermine faith in his role as a prophet, so was inappropriate.

    Bush also reports notes from Robert A. Rees, the editor for Dialogue (the journal that was planning to publish Bush's research), in a conversation with the Academic Vice President at BYU Robert K. Thomas, conveying pressure from general authorities to discourage publication:

    > Brother Thomas began ... by saying that he had heard some disturbing things about an article which Dialogue was going to be publishing on Mormonism and the Negro and that even though he had not seen the article the indications of the conversations that he had had made him feel that this was a Rubicon river for Dialogue. The initial inquiry or at least one of the inquiries came to [then BYU president] Dallin Oaks in regard to the quotation of the material from the Bennion papers which are at Brigham Young University and Bob said that because... materials from those papers were used in the Dialogue article, that Brigham Young University was going to be in big trouble, He said that he had gotten several calls... from several highly placed sources asking explicit questions about BYU and ... in terms of his experience ... over a long period of time the original source of those inquiries was unmistakenly from the General Authorities.  He said that if Dialogue prints Bush’s article the brethren will think that Dialogue is hostile. He said that to this point that Dialogue has not been considered hostile but that the brethren will clearly think that if we publish this article...

    He describes a conversation with Leonard Arrington regarding the Bennion Papers:

    > ... A few months later I heard from the special collections staffer at BYU that “Some time after your statement that you used the Bennion papers at the University, the Library was contacted in behalf of the First Presidency stating that we should not have copies of the councils’ minutes and requested [that the library] send them up..." ...

    There were also attempts by Apostle Mark E. Petersen to have Lester Bush disciplined:

    > [J. Willard Marriot Jr., Bush's stake president] said he had received a telephone call from Apostle Marke E. Petersen, who had spoken "very harshly" about me over my publications on the "Negro Doctrine" and instructed Marriott to call me in and take some appropriate action.

* **1978**&nbsp; LeGrand Richards denied the existence of the seerstone

    Elder Richards denied the existence of the seerstone [in an interview](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/legrand-richards-denied-existence-of-seerstone/).  (may have been benign ignorance)

* **1981**&nbsp; Bruce R. McConkie misleads about teaching of the Adam God theory

    Elder McConkie appears to have [misled on the teaching of the Adam God theory](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/bruce-r-mcconkie-misled-on-adam-god/).  Also, consider Boyd Kirkland's allegations in that same link demonstrating general suppression by LDS leadership of the idea that Adam-God was taught by Brigham Young.

* **1984**&nbsp; Speaking bans to limit the influence of "Mormon Enigma"

    Believing scholars Valeen Tippetts Avery and Linda King Newell published Mormon Enigma in 1984.  It won several Mormon history awards (including a BYU sponsored award).  Inquiries about Church sanction of the book prompted LDS leadership to ban Avery and Newell from speaking about Church history generally in LDS meetings.  When they finally were able to meet with the Apostles responsible for the ban, Newell noted their motivation.  As conveyed in [this Dialogue article](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V35N02_15.pdf):

    > [Dallin] Oaks explained the decision to order the ban included the fact that "your book represents a non-traditional view of Joseph Smith" and thus may damage the faith of church members who read it. Linda explained that the letters and calls she had received from readers described a positive reaction. Oaks acknowledged that possibility yet maintained that he believed "the weight of the evidence was on the other side."  Jack [Linda's husband] countered that the issue was whether or not the book was an honest and true portrayal of the facts, readers reactions being incidental. When Linda asked whether the two apostles had read the book, [Neil] Maxwell did not answer and Oaks admitted he had only read portions of it, citing time constraints as the reason. He acknowledged that in what he had read, Linda and Avery had used restraint when discussing aspects of Joseph Smith's life and his relationship with Emma. Apparently, however, it was not enough. After more discussion, Oaks emphasized that, despite his academic background and reputation as a scholar and intellectual, his duty as an apostle meant he had an obligation to "protect what is most unique about the LDS church" and stressed that "if Mormon Enigma reveals information that is detrimental to the reputation of Joseph Smith, then it is necessary to try to limit its influence and that of its authors."

* **~1985**&nbsp; Attempted suppression of publication of Roberts's Studies of the Book of Mormon

    When B. H. Roberts's descendants tried to get his Book of Mormon scholarship published decades after his death, it is alleged by one of the contributors to the volume, Sterling McMurrin, that the Church tried to suppress its publication (see [footnote #11](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/response-to-callister-bom-manmade-or-godgiven/#fn:mcmurrinsuppress)).

* **2001, 2003**&nbsp; Church manuals leave out difficult polygamy details

    The D&C and Church History manuals include [very limited coverage of Joseph Smith's polygamy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MormonDoctrine/comments/9ava6z/the_two_institute_manuals_where_wed_expect_to_see/).  For instance, there is no mention of Fanny Alger and no mention that many of those Joseph had sealed to him were already married to other men.

* **2011**&nbsp; Lorenzo Snow manual ellipses on tithing

    The ellipses used in the Lorenzo Snow manual [changed the intent of Snow's statement on tithing](https://wasmormon.org/the-tithing-ellipsis/).

* **2012**&nbsp; Gospel topics essays given a "soft rollout"

    In an undated recording, Elder Steven Snow describes [how the gospel topics essays were released](https://clyp.it/gq0cdhf1#):

    > I think it’d be helpful to know how we chose to roll those out. It was a soft roll out. There wasn’t an announcement saying “You can go to this website to learn everything weird about the Mormon church you ever wanted to learn”. (Laughter from the audience) But yet we had a lot of people struggling with some of these issues. We were loosing young people particularly. And we felt we owed a safe place for people to go to get these answered. So they were deliberately kind of placed in an existing database, so they wouldn’t …. You know, 90% of the church probably couldn’t care less, they don’t worry about such things. But we do have some folks who are on-line and we felt like they needed a safe place to go to get answers if they had questions. So I don’t think you are gonna see a well publicised campaign to tell you to go to these sites.

* **2012**&nbsp; Denial of access to Joseph Fielding Smith's diaries

    When Stan Larson asked for access to Joseph Fielding Smith's diaries to better understand the context and motivation for handling and suppression of the 1832 account, [he was denied access](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/1832-first-vision-account-suppressed/#why-not-an-earlier-dating).

* **2012**&nbsp; Wickman portrays prop 8 efforts in California as primarily a grassroots effort

    In an interview conducted by Church media in 2012, [Elder Lance Wickman stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZzkeuR423k&feature=youtu.be&t=57):

    > contrary to what some may think it was the members not the church, yes the First Presidency of the church sent a letter that was read in sacrament meeting urging members to get involved, and thats all that was needed and they were galvanized by it.

    However, a powerpoint presentation leaked to Mormonleaks called [Proposition 8 Grassroots Program](https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/index.php?title=File:Proposition_8_Grassroots_Program.pdf) included detailed heirarchical organization charts and strategies suggesting the movement was directed and organized in top-down fashion.

* **2012**&nbsp; Purdy evades question on SCMC

    When John Sweeney asked a direct question about the existence of the [Strengthening Church Members Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strengthening_Church_Members_Committee), Michael Purdy appeared to be [initially evasive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgKVCyGf-Ak).

* **2012**&nbsp; Holland misleads about temple oaths

    Elder Holland appears to have [attempted to mislead John Sweeney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9v2GxDs4To&feature=youtu.be&t=80) when Sweeney was asking about Romney and the temple oaths he would have sworn.  Jonathon Streeter [has analyzed this in depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPVpUJj_gbs). [warning: discussion of the temple and oaths]

* **2013**&nbsp; Steven Snow admits the past tendency to prevent access to information

    Steven Snow recently [stated](https://mi.byu.edu/truth-in-church-history-excerpts-from-the-religious-educators-qa-with-elder-steven-snow/):

    > I think in the past there was a tendency to keep a lot of the records closed or at least not give access to information. But the world has changed in the last generation—with the access to information on the Internet, we can’t continue that pattern; I think we need to continue to be more open.

* **2018**&nbsp; Anderson states "we are not a wealthy people"

    Elder Anderson may have misled Zimbabwe's prime minister [regarding the wealth of the Church]({{ "/we-are-not-a-wealthy-people/" | relative_url }}).

* **2018**&nbsp; obfuscation of living allowances

    I performed a [fairly comprehensive analysis](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/how-transparent-was-lds-church-with-living-allowances/) of how the Church portrays living allowances for its senior male leadership.  A good example of how the Church has obfuscated living allowances can be found in [this section](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/how-transparent-was-lds-church-with-living-allowances/#lds-newsroom-obfuscation).

* **2020**&nbsp; leaders did not want members to know about the size of Ensign Peak investments

    Based on Roger Clarke's interview with the Wall Street Journal (as [reported by the Salt Lake Tribune](https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/02/08/lds-church-kept-lid-its-b/)), it became apparent that LDS officials "kept the size of the church's $100 billion investment reserves secret"

* **2013--2020**&nbsp; misleading footnotes in Gospel Topics essays and Come Follow Me Manual

    The Gospel Topics essays sometimes use footnotes in a manner that poorly reflects (or maybe even reverses) the meaning of the original source material.  The most egregious of these is [footnote #9 in the race and the priesthood essay](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uGbG1kvsluwiKvqrkQP7h7RocsrWC4cb/view).  Consider other examples discussed [here](https://www.ldsdiscussions.com/footnotes).

* **1830--2020**&nbsp; seer stone usage misrepresentations

    Almost since the beginning of the Church, the Book of Mormon translation process, especially with regards to use of the seer stone, seems like it could have been presented with greater transparency or accuracy.  Consider candidates [in this presentation by japanesepiano](https://www.docdroid.net/C32AVOh/deliberate-deception-related-to-the-seer-stone-pdf), many of which occurred relatively recently.

## Remaining questions

What responsibility does the organization have for presenting or publicizing unsavory, potentially damaging, or uncomfortable information to its members?  It seems fair to point out that the Church holds its members to exacting standards of honesty and transparency.  For instance, the [Ensign in 1994 taught](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1994/10/thou-shalt-not-bear-false-witness?lang=eng):

> We can also be guilty of bearing false witness and lying if we say nothing, particularly if we allow another to reach a wrong conclusion while we hold back information that would have led to a more accurate perception. In this case it is as though an actual lie were uttered… Lying and misrepresentation in all of their forms are wrong, no matter how they may be rationalized, and those who silently let these evils pass unchallenged are also doing wrong

Other remaining questions include: 

* Should [institutions apologize](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/the-church-does-not-apologize/) for times they were not fully transparent?  Should the Church?
* If these are the instances we are aware of today, how many instances have still not been brought to light?  Can the Church "fully repent" (or make amends) as an institution without a full accounting?
* Can we say that the Church is fully transparent today?  What would they need to do to convince an unbiased 3rd party that was the case?
* Are the cultural forces that hindered transparency in the past still active in the Church today?

## Acknowledgements

I received valuable feedback on a first draft of this document from the Mormon Historians facebook group, especially Anthony D. Miller, Jonathon Ellis, Ryan Larsen, Mary Ann Clements, Brian Hanson, Christian Anderson, James Davenport, Joe Geisner, and Robin Jensen.

[^bush]: Lester Bush's research has been reported to have [catalyzed internal discussions among LDS leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_people_and_Mormonism&oldid=972699940#End_of_the_temple_and_priesthood_ban) that would pave the way for overturning the Priesthood/Temple ban.

[^models]: So many choices in our lives hinge upon which model we subscribe to, and which model we subscribe to is directly influenced by the data we have at our disposal by which to evaluate the strength of competing models.

[^modern]: I am aware of probably just as many examples of the early LDS Church failing to be transparent as the modern Church, but this document is focused on the modern Church.

[^montez]: My point in citing Shannon Montez's masters thesis is to demonstrate that LDS leadership have known about potentially troubling issues with Book of Mormon historicity for a long time.  Montez concludes that B.H. Roberts probably did not believe in the historicity of the Book of Mormon towards the end of his life, but it is not clear if she grappled with the [data suggesting that Roberts may indeed have believed in a historical Book of Mormon](https://www.plonialmonimormon.com/2020/08/b-h-roberts-and-the-book-of-mormon-exhumation-and-reburial.html).  I personally think it's difficult to decide the state of Roberts's belief at the end of his life.  At the very least, these issues seemed a challenge to him.

[^dishonesty]:  To be able to demonstrate dishonesty, a person typically needs to establish who knew what and when, and even then a case to establish motivation may merely be suggestive.
