1. In 1989, Glenn L. Pace stated that "A prophet doesn't take a poll to see which way the wind of public opinion is blowing", but the Church has just recently conducted a survey on the Temple which prompted the dropping of penalties associated with the endowment covenants.

1. Earlier thinking emphasized need not to found ideas on corruptions, while later thinking justified thinking based on widespread (corrupt) ideas:
    > But we do not wish to sustain our own position upon the corruptions of others - our own position, as it is in the mind and revelations of God. God forbid that our faith should be founded upon the corruptions of the world. Our faith is founded upon the purity of the word of life, and there let it be grounded.  (Orson Hyde JOD 2:76-79 1854)

    > The justifications for this restriction echoed the widespread ideas about racial inferiority that had been used to argue for the legalization of black “servitude” in the Territory of Utah. (Race and the Priesthood Topics Essay)

1. Earlier thinking emphasized that revelations always come with a reason for it while later thinking emphasized that revelation was given without reasons:

    > Whenever truth is manifested by revelation to the servants of God, it never comes without a reason for it. (Orson Hyde 1854 JOD 2:76-79)

    > If you read the scriptures with this question in mind, ‘Why did the Lord command this or why did he command that’ you find that in less than one in a hundred commands was any reason given. It's not the pattern of the Lord to give reasons. (Oaks The Times-News, 09 Jun 1988, Page 15)

1. Drinking coffee, which is [healthy for a person on the whole](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%28%28%22coffee%22%5BMeSH%20Terms%5D%20OR%20%22coffee%22%5BAll%20Fields%5D%29%20AND%20%28%22health%22%5BMeSH%20Terms%5D%20OR%20%22health%22%5BAll%20Fields%5D%29%29%20AND%20Review%5Bptyp%5D&cmd=DetailsSearch), will keep you out of the temple, will drive away the Spirit, and may invite the destroying angel upon you, while consuming large amounts of sugary or diet soft drinks and highly caffeinated energy drinks, which are arguably worse for a persons health overall, will do none of those things.
