On the 9th of December, 2018, during his meeting with Zimbabwe's Vice President, Elder Neil L. Andersen stated:

> We are not a wealthy people but we are good people, and we share what we have

Elder Anderson may not have been fully aware of all the assets the LDS Church holds at the time of making this statement (for instance, only certain leaders knew about [Ensign Peak Advisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ensign_Peak_Advisors&oldid=971340278), but the LDS Church is thought to be [the single wealthiest religious organization in the world behind the Vatican](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_wealthiest_organizations&oldid=974310014) with a total worth [upwards of $100 Billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finances_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints&oldid=961501561#Assets).
