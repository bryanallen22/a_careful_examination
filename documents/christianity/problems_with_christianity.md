## Believing in Jesus promotes much that is good

### Christianity promotes love and selflessness.

The Gospels promote many beautiful ideals:

* "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets." (Matthew 7:12)
* "Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.  And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.  And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.  Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.  Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.  But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust." (Matthew 5:38--45)
* "Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.  Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?  When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?  Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?  And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." (Matthew 25:34--40)

It's difficult to overstate the power of these ideals.  These ideas existed (often to a somewhat lesser degree) in other cultures or religions, but they are persistently and emphatically stressed by Jesus.  Much of the good that has been done in the world in the past 2000 years was motivated, at least in part, by these ideals.

### Idea of eternal life may diminish existential anxiety

The idea of a resurrection or eternal life may diminish existential anxiety for some people.

### Attending Church is healthy

### In some ways Jesus promoted equality of the sexes

In *some* ways that may have transcended his society [Jesus fought against patriarchy](https://radicaljesusfollowers.blogspot.com/2016/12/11-ways-jesus-fought-patriarchy.html).

## Believing in Jesus may also promote some harmful attitudes

**_A belief in the teachings of Jesus may:_**

### Hinder introspection and the quest for Truth.

The desire to maintain a belief in God and Christ tends to hinder a person from searching for and fairly evaluate the evidence that might contradict that belief.

Mark 4:28-29

> Truly I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter; but whoever blasphemies against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin.

Mark 8:11-12

> The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, to test him. And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, "Why does this generation need a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation."

Mark 16:16

> He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.

This avoidance of introspection seems to be directly correlated with level of belief (i.e., JW > Mormon > SDA > Evangelical > Catholic > Protestant > UU).  Generally, the stronger the belief in God and Jesus, the less likely a person or group seems to be willing to confront facts which might potentially undermine that belief.

### Promote second-coming nihilism and anxiety.

Whereas the belief in the resurrection may quell anxiety, a belief in Jesus is also tied to a belief in his second coming, and the second coming may promote nihilism and anxiety.

Belief in the imminent return of Jesus with accompanying cataclysms (see Matthew 24 and the Book of Revelation) is [woven deeply into Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_and_claims_for_the_Second_Coming_of_Christ)

* It deeply affects how Christians live today, causing many to be ill-prepared for living a full life (anecdotes [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/k3zg4i/does_anyone_else_feel_like_they_werent_prepared/)).
* It colored expectations within the early LDS Church (see [here](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/failed-second-coming-predictions-in-early-lds-church/))
* Throughout its existence, LDS members have been told [they will live to see the second coming](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/6rctgu/if_your_patriarchal_blessing_indicates_you_will/).
* LDS members today have vivid and concrete expectations for Jesus's [immediate return](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/modern-second-coming-predictions/).

### Promote eternal judgement anxiety

Most people focus on the immediate consequences of their actions.  What harm
will my actions cause?  What good will this do?

In the back of most Christian minds is the idea that the wrong beliefs or
actions might result in their *eternal torment*.  In the back of every LDS
mind is the belief that they might be separated from their family (except for
short visitation rights) and always full of regret for what might have been
(living a life of complete joy and endless reproduction) if they fail to live
up completely to very strict covenants.  A single unrepentant "sin", no matter
how small, is enough to separate a person from God and their family for all of
eternity.

### An attitude of "doctrine over person"

* John taught that if a person believed in a different doctrinal version of Jesus Christ (i.e., the gnostic doctrine) that they should not say "hi" to them or invite them into your house.  [2 John 1: 7-11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-jn/1.7-11) 

* Jesus Christ discouraged a disciple from burying his father with the
  statement "let the dead bury their dead".  This teaching is used by
  believers to prioritize Church and religion over family and non-believers.

*  "Another said, 'I will follow you, Lord; but let me first say farewell to those at my home.' Jesus said to him, 'No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.' (Luke 9:61--62)

* [Luke 14:26](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/14.26)

> If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

### An emphasis on "sin" instead of morality

Christianity and Mormonism both place a strong emphasis on "sin", and this can stunt moral reasoning and warp behavior so that what is most moral is secondary to what is considered "sin", [no matter the moral consequence or magnitude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-dfOQUc8vQ&feature=emb_logo).

Consider Richard Bellrock's arguments in [Sin Does Not Exist: And Believing That It Does Is Ruining Us](https://sunstonemagazine.com/sin-does-not-exist/).

### Potentially harmful sexual attitudes

Religious belief is directly and strongly correlated with teenage pregnancy (see [this plot](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6stywg/graph_of_teen_pregnancies_by_state_as_compared_to/)).  In addition, while an emphasis on total abstinence before marriage may be beneficial for some individuals and has some clear advantages (e.g., no risk of pregnancy or STDs), the all "off" and then all "on" nature of sexuality in this model seems detrimental to some individuals and relationships.

Sexuality is [rife with moral concerns](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/why-sex-linked-to-morality/).  Christianity tends to deal with sex via guilt and shame, and Latter-day Saint leaders have consistently taught that sexual sin is [next to murder in severity](http://ldsanswers.org/is-sexual-sin-next-to-murder-book-of-mormon-central-fact-check/), which again, may warp an individual's moral calculus.

### Division in families over belief

If everyone does not believe in Jesus (in the same way), this may generate conflict.

Matthew 10:35-37:

> For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man's foes will be those of his own household. He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

Luke 18:29-30: And he said to them, "Truly, I say to you, there is no man who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, who will not receive manifold more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life."

### Disunity

Beliefs grounded dogmatically in the unverifiable promotes eventual disunity.  There are tens, if not hundreds, of Latter-day Saint [schismatic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_denominations_in_the_Latter_Day_Saint_movement) and hundreds if not thousands of [schismatic Christian groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations).

The history of Christianity is one of unreconcilable differences centered in dogmatism over unfalsifiable beliefs (e.g., consider the [history of the Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity#History)).

### The idea of the inherent superiority of certain groups of people

Story of the Canaanite woman: Matthew 15:22-28

> But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel

### Reluctance to unequivocally condemn slavery

Because neither the Old Testament or the New Testament unequivocally condemn slavery, the Bible was used as *justification* for slavery for centuries (discussed [here](https://time.com/5171819/christianity-slavery-book-excerpt/) among many other places).

Brigham Young's [speech to the Legislature in 1852](https://archive.org/details/CR100317B0001F0014) demonstrates this connection:

>  I will remark with regard to slavery, inasmuch as we believe in the Bible, inasmuch as we believe in the ordinances of God, in the Priesthood and order and decrees of God, we must believe in slavery. This colored race have been subjected to severe curses, which they have in their families and their classes and in their various capacities brought upon themselves. And until the curse is removed by Him who placed it upon them, they must suffer under its consequences; I am not authorized to remove it. I am a firm believer in slavery.

And you will still find tons of run-of-the-mill Christians today **still** justifying slavery ([for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSKj3LQilcI&feature=youtu.be)) which is the only conclusion about the morality of slavery consistent with the Bible, I think, even though I find that conclusion deeply troubling and the justifications poor (the arguments do not generalize well and avoid the core problem of slavery which is lack of self-determination which is a core human value--all the other things we value tend to hinge on self-determination).
