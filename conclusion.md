### Conclusion

At this point, I have spent thousands of hours accumulating evidence and arguments which convincingly demonstrate (at least to me) that the LDS Church is not what it claims to be.  At best, the institution provides its adherents useful social and theological constructs around which to order their lives, but is still a poor disseminator of truth. At worst, the institution cares little for truth---it frequently [whitewashes and hides its own history](https://proveallthingsholdfasttogood.wordpress.com/the-hiding-of-church-history/)---and the culture it is responsible for is deeply harmful in some regards to some kinds of people, and many individuals are probably better off leaving the institution.

I was somehow convinced that close friends, family members, or ward members would want to discuss truth-claim data and arguments with me (which motivated me to take careful notes of the evidence and arguments).  I am easy to talk with, quickly acknowledge good points, and feel no compulsion to persuade another person to adopt my way of thinking---I merely hope that they would consider my thoughts, as I consider theirs.  At the very least, understanding the data I found compelling could help dispel the assumption that I had forfeited my soul to Satan---I chose a different path based on compelling evidence and arguments and not because of a deficiency in character.

**No such discussions ever occurred.  Not once.**

It has been nearly 3.5 years since my faith transition and over 3 years since my resignation.  I have never had a single substantial discussion about the truth-claim data with any believing individual (outside of anonymous online interaction) since my faith transition.  This single data point has been the most troubling of all to me.  I had assumed that, like me (at least leading up to my faith transition), Latter-day Saints deeply valued understanding _all_ truth.  The deep desire manifest by friends, family, and ward members to avoid truth-claim data _seems_ to suggest otherwise.  For a people who are generally well-educated and who spend countless hours reading scripture and discussing God and the LDS Church, what could account for this nearly primal drive to flee from discussing the truth-claim data?

#### God (and the LDS Church) as Surrogate Parent

As discussed in [this outstanding video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A) :

> The primary psychological function of the concept of a personal god is to give the believer a surrogate parent. Some minds are able to become independent of parental figures; others cannot or fall into self-destructive behaviors without them. Minds in this category rely on religion. The God concept is useful for motivating and pacifying them.

In the LDS Church, the Brethren act as a flesh-and blood parent (or perhaps older sibling?), and they lay out and modify programs for living which ease the existential anxiety of members and help to make the concept of God and an orderly, purposeful universe far more tangible than it would otherwise be.

This model goes far to explain the extreme avoidance the vast majority of believing members have of genuinely exploring LDS truth-claims.  As articulated [here](https://deconversion.net/2012/10/02/the-concept-of-god-as-a-surrogate-parent/):

> From all this [God as surrogate parent] we can now readily understand why theistic believers become so upset when challenged about their beliefs. Just think of how a child reacts if you impugn the character of his/her parents. In like manner, a biologically adult human who believes in a god or gods is attached to a parent still and will, like a child, bristle because you challenge their source of security, nourishment, and all things good.

> Remember how anguished most of us were when we first deconverted? We experienced "leaving home" and for the first time in our lives  and we stood alone as true adults without a parent. That is apparently not something most humans want.

Ultimately, then, the desire and ability to voluntarily grapple directly with the truth-claim data about one's own parental-like religion must be preceded by achieving some kind of _ideological_ adulthood.[^1]

The statement I have often heard repeated by friends and family: "Even if the LDS Church weren't true, I would still want to live it" takes on new meaning.  The program and assurance the LDS Church provides insulates a member from making open-ended and difficult decisions about how to order their own life: it provides a scaffold upon which to hang and organize all of life's activities.  Unless/until a person has discovered or constructed enough independent ideological scaffold upon which to organize their worldview, the purely elective examination of LDS truth-claims would be akin to taking a sledgehammer to their own home to determine how sturdy the home is.  This would be an act of insanity unless or until they have constructed alternative ideological edifices which can be retreated to in the event that the LDS/God structure is found worthy of condemnation or they have been shown the flimsiness of the edifice to the point that that they fear for their ideological lives due to imminent collapse.  Those individuals who took the sledgehammer of scrutiny to their ideological edifice before having constructing an alternative edifice experience a "faith crisis" while those with an existing alternative edifice experience the far less destabilizing, but still painful, "faith transition".

That is not to suggest that those who are yet incapable of genuinely examining LDS truth-claims are, on the whole, developmentally inferior than those who have investigated---these individuals may be psychologically independent or further developed in many _other_ facets of
life than a given truth-claim investigator.  In addition, these kinds of propensities may be based in large part on genetic-based tendencies or environmental contingencies outside the control of the individual.  Finally, it's worth noting that a believing member unable or unwilling to explore the truth-claim data may be able to achieve more within the LDS scaffold than their truth-claim investigating counterparts outside the LDS scaffold since the believer must devote fewer mental and emotional resources to the daunting exploration of the existential than the investigator.

With this model in mind, we can reframe the question of truth-seeking among Latter-day Saints.  Latter-day Saints are genuine seekers of truth within the confines of their religion, much as a child or teen is genuinely curious about their home and the world around them.  They will venture and learn, and they are eager to explore on trips with their parents, but that exploration is always bounded by the authority of the primary parental figure in their life---in this metaphor the LDS institution.

Discussion of difficult LDS truth-claim data is likely to be viewed as an assault on their core identity, and as demonstrated in MRI studies of those considering facts which threaten their core political ideology, such discussion is likely to activate [the same brain structures responsible for assessing threats to _physical_ safety](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39589), accounting for the primal urge to either demonize the "attacker" (fight) or flee from such discussion (flight).

This model also suggests both productive and destructive modes for interacting with believing members.  _In matters of religion_ (please note this does not extend to other facets of life), the believing member must generally be treated as a child still under the guardianship of their parent.  Their growth can be encouraged, but never in opposition to their primary parental figure (the LDS institution).  To suggest to a child that their parent is a poor guide for edification or truth would, in most cases, be highly destabilizing to them, and the same goes for the LDS institution and explains why members often distance themselves from those who share such information in an effort to help.  The most productive route, I would argue, is merely to encourage them in their religious growth with the expectation that, if or when they are developmentally ready, they will be able to achieve religious adulthood.  Like most stages of development (e.g., the butterfly exiting its cocoon), achieving ideological adulthood cannot be forced from the outside, and excessive effort to hurry the process along is likely to do more harm than good.

[^1]: I'm aware that this metaphor is inverted within the LDS worldview.  In the LDS worldview a major goal of life is to humbly choose to become "children of God" (see Mosiah 5), and this worldview would view those who would go on to achieve "ideological adulthood" as those who have succumbed to the pride of the natural man---fooling themselves into thinking that they know better than God and his chosen leaders.  If we are willing to assume the inherent goodness of critically examining one's own religion's truth-claims, it then becomes obvious which of the two inversions is more accurate, at least in the majority of cases.
