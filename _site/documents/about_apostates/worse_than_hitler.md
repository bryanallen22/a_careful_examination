I was essentially closeted at the time but this was one of the last days I would attend seminary before deciding I couldn't play along anymore.

We were talking about the requirements for getting heaven and how people who didn't have a chance to learn about the gospel in this life would be taught and allowed to accept it in the next life. My teacher had brought up that because we were given our chance on earth we would not be given a chance in the afterlife, and that Hell really only existed for members who denied the existence of god and left the church. He then went on to talk about how even Hitler would eventually be allowed into heaven after being taught the gospel.

As the entire class sat in agreement over the amazing stretches of Christ's love or something I remember thinking I would be unanimously looked down upon as someone who had commit worse sins than Hitler by my entire community had I come out and stated I no longer believed.
