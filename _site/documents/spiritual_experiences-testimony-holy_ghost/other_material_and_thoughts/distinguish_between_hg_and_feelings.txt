Likely from Bednar (or implicitly endorsed by him):

Q: Am I feeling the Holy Ghost or my own feelings? A: Don't worry about it. If you are living the gospel, both should influence you to do good.

You don't need an apostle to receive answers to your questions. You can receive your own answers from God through his messenger the Holy Ghost.
