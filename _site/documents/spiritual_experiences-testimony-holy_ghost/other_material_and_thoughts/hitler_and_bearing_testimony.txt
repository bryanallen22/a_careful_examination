"But the most brilliant [teaching] technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly and with unflagging attention. It must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over. Here, as so often in this world, persistence is the first and most important requirement for success."
"[Bearing testimony] must be aimed at the emotions and only to a very limited degree at the so-called intellect..."
The art of [teaching] lies in understanding the emotional ideas of the [investigator] and finding, through a psychologically correct form, the way to the attention and thence to the heart of the [investigator]."

Bear testimony several times in each lesson, not just at the end. Bear testimony that what your companion has taught is from God. Bear testimony that the principle you are going to teach will bless the investigators’ lives if they will follow it.

To bear testimony is to give a simple, direct declaration of belief—a feeling, an assurance, a conviction of gospel truth.

People may sometimes intellectually question what you teach, but it is difficult to question a sincere, heartfelt testimony.

An effective missionary teaches, testifies, and invites others to do things that build faith in Jesus Christ. This includes making promises that come from living true principles. For example, a missionary might say, “I know as you keep the Sabbath day holy, you will find more peace in your heart.”
