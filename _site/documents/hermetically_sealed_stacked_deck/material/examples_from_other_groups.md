36:30

These people hate us, 

You can't trust them.

You are either a Jacob or an Esau.  If you are Jacob you want nothing to do with the world.

Did you form close friendships with people who were outside your Church and if so, what was that like?

Not very close because we were always really suspicious of people outside the Church... Of course, this was something that was drummed into us all our lives.  "These people hate each other" we would say.  And they certainly hate us.  They don't care about you.  They don't care about each other.  All they want to do is live how they wnat to live and encourage one another in their sins and you can't trust them.

"The stronger your group identity the greater your ability to suppress empathy
for the outgroup."


"God is the only person authorized to criticize his messengers."

When we focus on the faults of others

We never engage in debate

We do not engage in any kind of debate.  We don't engage in debate.

The media is Satan's media, hence you should not believe any attacks on our Church that comes through the media.



Satan believes we are only loyal for what we get out of it.  Hence, being
loyal to the JWs, even if it is contrary to our health of happiness is a way to disprove Satan.

Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and lean unto him and


...should we listen to apostates, read their literature, or examine their Web sites on the Internet? If we love God and the truth, we will not do so. We should not allow apostates into our homes or even greet them, for such actions would make us ‘sharers in their wicked works.’ (2 John 9-11)

Instead of discussing the information, the conversation immediately turns to
Satan:
