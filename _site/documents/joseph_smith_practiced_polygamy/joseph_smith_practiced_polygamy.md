## Contemporary evidence that Joseph Smith practiced polygamy

Joseph Smith made [*many* public denials that he was practicing polygamy](http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/common-questions/polygamy-denials/).  In an effort to exonerate him, some take him at his word and claim that polygamy was an invention of Brigham Young.

However, fairly strong *contemporary* evidence exists that Joseph Smith practiced polygamy:

1. [Oliver Cowdery's letter to Warren A. Cowdery, Jan 21, 1838](https://imgur.com/UXN9wpv).  Note that all surrounding events and testimony (including the fact that Cowdery never retracted his accusation) corroborate that Joseph Smith was intimately involved with Fanny Alger.
2. [D&C 132, received 12 July 1843](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-12-july-1843-dc-132/1).
