1. Tell people what the 'truth' is.
2. Have them ask God what is true.
3. 'God' will confirm it because 'God' is their inner voice and it has been properly conditioned.

If 'God' is telling them the wrong thing, keep conditioning until 'God' agrees with the 'truth'.


1. Make assertions.
2. If they feel good when they make an assertion, the assertion was true
3. If they assertion is shown false, adjust the meaning of the assertion to fit.
